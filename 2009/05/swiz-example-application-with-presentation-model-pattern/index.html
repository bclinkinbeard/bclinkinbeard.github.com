			<p>About a month ago I was introduced to the <a href="http://swizframework.googlecode.com/">Swiz</a> application framework for Flex. Within an hour or so, I was not only sold on the simplicity and effectiveness of the framework, I was digging around in the source adding features. Shortly after that I started collaborating more closely with <a href="http://cdscott.blogspot.com/">Chris Scott</a>, creator of Swiz and a coworker of mine, and <a href="http://soenkerohde.com/">Sönke Rohde</a>, the other Swiz team member. The three of us have been cranking away adding new features ever since and have a lot planned for the coming months.</p>
<p>Now that introductions are out of the way, let&#8217;s look at some code. I&#8217;m really not going to try and explain much of anything here because I&#8217;ve done that (heavily) in the code and comments of the application. In the recent past I have repeatedly found myself frustrated with a lack of examples when reading about new frameworks or projects people are promoting. I learn best and quickest when I can see something in action and figure out how it works, so I created this example for other people like me. If you have questions, comments or suggestions about the application you can obviously post them here, or you can post them in the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/swiz-framework">Swiz Google Group</a> where I will also be posting a link.</p>
<p>Lastly, a couple of disclaimers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Only the Employees view of the application contains anything. I only created multiple tabs to facilitate the mode monitor at the bottom of the app.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve placed the ASDocs above the metadata tags for the sake of readability and simplicity. In a real application the ASDocs (unfortunately) go between the metadata and the code.</li>

<p>But I&#8217;ve a problem when Swiz injects my members on my views like in your Employee-View. So i listen on the creationComplete-Event of my view and want to have at this moment access to the from swiz injected member.

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-554" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>this looks great! A.t.m. I&#8217;m investigating different frameworks and Swiz is very promising. I really like the use of metadata for mediation and that you guys use mxml for the IoC container. Im also looking at Spring actionscript and Parsley. every one has great features&#8230; difficult to choose <img src='../../../wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Swiz definately seems the most lean and mean, Spring actionscript has the most powerful Ioc container and supports changing the settings without recompiling which may come in handy with systems in production. But this comes with a price tag: No good ide support and you need to manually include classes that are used in the context. Parsley seems to be very complete, both schemes are supported, but have to investigate further.</p>
<p>Anyway, success with the further implementation! One thing i would focus on is a good example with modules. These days with so many frameworks it&#8217;s on if the first questions many people ask. Looks great, but how does it handle modules (and module / shell communication)?</p>
<p>cheers, Arnoud</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-555" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>@ArgV &#8211; As it stands now, Swiz does its injections in response to the ADDED_TO_STAGE event, which happens after CREATION_COMPLETE. The next feature I will be working on is making the injection event configurable, so you will be able to make Swiz inject values earlier if you so choose. In the meantime, if you implement IInitializingBean, Swiz will call initialize once the injections have been made, allowing you to utilize those values.</p>
<p>@Arnoud &#8211; Thanks. I/we agree module support is very important and an official workflow is coming. Keep an eye on the Google Group and elsewhere for announcement of when that is finalized.</p>

<p>I got two questions&#8230;</p>
<p>1&#8230; By looking at your mvc structure&#8230; where you would put custom classes?&#8230; This might be not that swiz specific&#8230; but I got issues in general to get my head around the question where to put custom classes within my MVC structure&#8230; sometimes when the app you are working on gets very graphical you need a lot of custom classes to deal with the view&#8230; and example would be an media player&#8230; buttons / states / animations and so on&#8230; now by bringing in another element like the presentation model the whole thing looks even harder understandable to me&#8230;</p>
<p>2 Regarding the use of these two interfaces within your app. Was it more the sake of an example? or why have you used interfaces in this particular case&#8230;. To me it doesn&#8217;t seem clear &#8230; Do you use interfaces for the presentation model in general ?</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-551" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Ben, major props for this app. I&#8217;ve spent the last hour going through it, and your use of ideal architectural conventions with not only Swiz, but the Presentation Model pattern is pristine and right on the money. This app truly demonstrates how flexible (no pun intended) that Swiz is and how it can be used in tandem with additional architectural design patterns. Most importantly, the example is simple, which maintains consistency with the Swiz framework objective and accurately represents the vision &#8211; to provide absolute simplicity for complex applications&#8230; which is the entire idea behind design patterns and micro-architectures in the first place. Yet, this truth has gotten so convoluted that we often see design patterns and micro-architectures adding another level of complexity&#8230; the exact opposite of what they&#8217;re intended for. Case in point, it is great to be working with people that understand this.</p>
<p>Bigups!<br />

How would you do this differently (or not) if say you had more ui elements and non application wide shared functionality in your employee view and needed an employee view controller to update the model and view appropriately.  Would you inject the employeeviewcontroller into the view at this point or would you pass an event from the presentation model to the controller and then update the model there (in which case does the view automagically get updated when the model does)&#8230;and of course why <img src='../../../wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> ?</p>
<p>Also I&#8217;ve been trying to figure out how to update the &#8220;currentState&#8221; of my views that have multiple states using this same type of architecture but the only solutions I&#8217;ve come up with are to listen for a custom StateChange event in my view and update the  currentState property in the mxml or pass the view to the presentation model and update it there&#8230;any ideas?  It looks like instead of using  states you just set the visible property on the form&#8230;  Thanks for any clarifications you can bring to beginners!</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-548" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>First, I should point out that if you are new to Flex, you might want to delay jumping into frameworks (even Swiz) and design patterns like presentation model. Its usually a better approach to learn and get comfortable with the Flex framework and what it provides by itself before getting into deeper topics. That way you better understand the problems the advanced topics are aiming to solve.</p>
<p>That being said, the presentation model is simply one option for designing an application, whether it uses Swiz or not. If you are not using PM you would generally just mediate events in your controller that are dispatched directly by views, or you could inject controllers into your views. The appropriate solution really depends on your app and its needs. Swiz does support a view attribute in the [Mediate] tag, which allows you to specify that a controller should only mediate events of the given type if they come from a view of the given type.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret I hate Flex states. <img src='../../../wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  I have never encountered a situation where I felt a state would solve my problem better than a visible toggle or addChild/removeChild would. The truth though, is that whether you use states or some other mechanism you generally will want to bind to a property on your model, so you can control your view in a meaningful way. Your controller or model should be setting properties like isEditing that your views bind to, not myView.visible = false.</p>
<p>Hope that helps,<br />
Ben</p>

<p>Great example first of all, and thanks for posting it. I have been meaning to separate my logic from my views for a while now, and this seems like a perfect way to do it.</p>
<p>In regards to your example, under the IEmployeeViewPresentationModel</p>
<p>You have:<br />
[Bindable( event="employeesChanged" )]<br />
function get employees():ArrayCollection;</p>
<p>How would employeesChanged get dispatched? I did a search and couldn&#8217;t find what calls this event&#8230;</p>
<p>Basically what I am trying to have happen is if I have a delegate that goes out, gets some data and lets say it updates the employees under the ApplicationModel, how would<br />
a) IEmployeeViewPresentationModel find out about it<br />
b) How do activate a particular function within the view EmployeeView when this model is changed?</p>
<p>I hope those 2 questions make sense,&#8230;and any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>2. Using Swiz.dispatchEvent() to dispatch a custom AlertEvent with title and text properties event and have the presentation model listen to it.<br />
–Swiz.dispatchEvent(new AlertEvent(AlertEvent.ALERT, title, text))</p>
<p>3. By adding a callback property in the UserEvent that is called by the mediator.<br />
–event.callBack(title, text)</p>
<p>4. By directly calling a method on the presentation model in the mediator by autowiring the presentation model into the controller.<br />
presentationModel.alert(title, text);</p>

<p>To answer your question, there are a few different ways you can accomplish this. You mention a mediator in your comments but I don&#8217;t generally use mediators. Mediators are more or less an alternative to presentation models, so the two usually aren&#8217;t used together. My preference would probably be close to your #2, with the main difference being the controller using an injected dispatcher. In fact, in Swiz 1.0 there will be no static methods on Swiz, so that will be the only way.</p>
<p>Hope that helps,<br />
Ben</p>

<p>By the way, the mediators I mentioned in the previous post were the Swiz dynamic mediators in the controller.</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-869" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Hey Ben, </p>
<p>I was thinking about your reply to James&#8217;s comment above and it raised a question &#8230; </p>
<p>PresentationModels seem to take the place of controllers in MVP so I&#8217;ve been essentially viewing them as alternatives to controllers (I know they differ, but for the most part that&#8217;s how I&#8217;ve been thinking of them) . </p>
<p>However, looking at the Swiz ServiceLayer example (<a href="http://bit.ly/9jzlZQ" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/9jzlZQ</a>) it is the controller which possesses the IResponder&#8217;s result/fault handlers.</p>
<p>If PMs are basically alternatives to Controllers, and these handlers don&#8217;t belong in PMs (I agree, that seems wrong) do you have a recommended setup that works well in practise?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Neil</p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-870" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Hey Neil,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve not researched MVP much at all, so am not 100% sure how it differs from MVC and PM. I don&#8217;t see PMs as alternatives to Controllers at all. I view PMs as more of a model adapter, whose purpose is to serve one or more views and present data to them, and provide an API to them in a semantically meaningful way.</p>
<p>So, a PM might expose a method called getContacts(), but behind the scenes it dispatches an event that is handled by a controller, or calls a method directly on a controller, and the controller in turn calls a service. When the service returns the controller (or a command, if you prefer) sets data on a model. One or more presentation models are generally bound to these larger, more general models in order to populate their local, semantically meaningful properties.</p>
<p>That was a mouthful, but hopefully it makes sense. I am starting to think maybe I should write a post about my approach to presentation models, since it seems to be a fairly common topic lately. Perhaps I will. <img src='../../../wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<p>&#8220;mvp&#8221; &#8211; oops, that&#8217;s me displaying my ignorance. I made an assumption that presenter = presentation model. Okay, so knowing that it&#8217;s meant to be mvc + pm clears things up a little.</p>
<p>If I do understand you properly: the PM would have a reference to both a controller/command and the main model (or at least properties of the main model), and the controller/command would have a reference to the main model  (or properties of it). The PM would update the model unless external data was required, in which case the controller /command would get the data and update the model.</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s not right let me know, else thanks very much for providing some clarification <img src='../../../wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

						<div id="dsq-comment-message-878" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>That is correct, Neil. My only addendum to that is I usually just have the PM dispatch an event (using Swiz&#8217;s system dispatcher) rather than having the PM directly reference the controller or command. Some people don&#8217;t like that though and do it exactly as you said. I think either way is fine, and its just a matter of personal preference.</p>
