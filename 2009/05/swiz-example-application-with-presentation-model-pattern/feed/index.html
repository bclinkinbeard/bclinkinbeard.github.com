		<description>Hi Ben, in the new Swiz documentation is this Presentation Model explained without the interfaces.  Is there any purpose, you have been using this interfaces?  I mean, I can imagine you could create different Presentation-Models with different implementations or maybe for Unit-Tests.
Thanks for your comments.

		<description>Hi Ben,  

Thanks for the example and source code.  However,  it looks like the sample source code is still written for swiz-0.6.1, which is not available for download on swiz web site.

It would be good if there are zip archive of the sample code for each never version of the swiz release, especially the most current one, 1.0-RC1.

Regards,</description>

		<description>When I import that project into Flash Builder 4 using the SDK3.5 I get :

Description	Resource	Path	Location	Type
Design mode: Cannot load swiz-0.6.1.b2.swc (reason: ERROR: Load Verify). It may require classes (such as Adobe AIR components) that are not supported by design mode. Check the Eclipse error log for more details.	SwizUserAdmin.mxml	/SwizUserAdmin/src	Unknown	Problem

When I create a news Project import SWIZ RC1 using SDK4.1 I get similar SDK errors.

How to use SWIZ with Flash Builder 4?</description>

		<description>That is correct, Neil. My only addendum to that is I usually just have the PM dispatch an event (using Swiz&#039;s system dispatcher) rather than having the PM directly reference the controller or command. Some people don&#039;t like that though and do it exactly as you said. I think either way is fine, and its just a matter of personal preference.</description>

		<description>Thanks, I think that makes sense (but I agree, an elaborated example/post would be a great idea given the interest).

&quot;mvp&quot; - oops, that&#039;s me displaying my ignorance. I made an assumption that presenter = presentation model. Okay, so knowing that it&#039;s meant to be mvc + pm clears things up a little.

If I do understand you properly: the PM would have a reference to both a controller/command and the main model (or at least properties of the main model), and the controller/command would have a reference to the main model  (or properties of it). The PM would update the model unless external data was required, in which case the controller /command would get the data and update the model.

If that&#039;s not right let me know, else thanks very much for providing some clarification :)</description>

		<description>Hey Neil,

I&#039;ve not researched MVP much at all, so am not 100% sure how it differs from MVC and PM. I don&#039;t see PMs as alternatives to Controllers at all. I view PMs as more of a model adapter, whose purpose is to serve one or more views and present data to them, and provide an API to them in a semantically meaningful way.

So, a PM might expose a method called getContacts(), but behind the scenes it dispatches an event that is handled by a controller, or calls a method directly on a controller, and the controller in turn calls a service. When the service returns the controller (or a command, if you prefer) sets data on a model. One or more presentation models are generally bound to these larger, more general models in order to populate their local, semantically meaningful properties.

That was a mouthful, but hopefully it makes sense. I am starting to think maybe I should write a post about my approach to presentation models, since it seems to be a fairly common topic lately. Perhaps I will. :)

		<description>Hey Ben, 

I was thinking about your reply to James&#039;s comment above and it raised a question ... 

PresentationModels seem to take the place of controllers in MVP so I&#039;ve been essentially viewing them as alternatives to controllers (I know they differ, but for the most part that&#039;s how I&#039;ve been thinking of them) . 

However, looking at the Swiz ServiceLayer example (http://bit.ly/9jzlZQ) it is the controller which possesses the IResponder&#039;s result/fault handlers.

If PMs are basically alternatives to Controllers, and these handlers don&#039;t belong in PMs (I agree, that seems wrong) do you have a recommended setup that works well in practise?

Thanks,
Neil</description>
