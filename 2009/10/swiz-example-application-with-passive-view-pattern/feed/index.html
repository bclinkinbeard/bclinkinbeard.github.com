		<description>Awesome article Ben!  Thanks so much for proving perspective on another pattern AND example code to boot!  Love it.  I&#039;ve used the Presentation model with Cairngorm quite a bit in the past and although I won&#039;t be switching to Passive View anytime soon, I appreciate your thoughts on it none the less.

I&#039;m in the process of creating a Flex social networking application (more to learn Flex 4 and Swiz than anything else) and I chose Swiz  purely because of the exuberance shown by those that believe in it, such as yourself.  Thanks a bunch.</description>

		<description>You&#039;re the man Ben. I think the most valuable thing here is that Swiz does not force the developer into a specific architectural implementation.  This is proven by these examples, where you are taking  different enterprise architectures as identified by Martin Fowler (whom I have a lot of respect for) in his writings, and applying them to the same application using the Swiz framework. Case in point, developers can use Swiz and still implement design patterns that meet the needs of their specific application. This is not the case at all with most of the other frameworks, with the exception of Mate probably.</description>

		<description>You may be right. I am seeing now that there is a spectrum between Passive View and Presentation Model.</description>

		<description>I think that is a perfectly valid approach, but I don&#039;t think it qualifies as Passive View. I think PV takes things a bit too far, and would actually prefer something like what you describe.</description>

		<description>Very interesting article!
I&#039;ve (kind of) recently discovered Swiz and must say I&#039;m impressed with what I&#039;ve seen. I&#039;m used to Java development with Spring, so Swiz is obviously looking good to me. Examples like these make it easier to figure out how to apply it to your own applications. Keep it up! ;)</description>

		<description>I would probably have the view put an Employee instance into an EmployeeEvent event, maybe EmployeeEvent.SAVE event, and dispatch it.</description>

		<description>Hey Robert,

How would you wire up the buttons&#039; click handlers and other view handlers then?

I agree that selectedEmployee could probably be moved into the view as you and Troy both suggest, but the mediator would still have to access the text properties of the inputs in order to update the model in response to a save action. In my opinion, if the mediator has to reach in in one instance, why not just let it do it in all instances and keep the view completely dumb?

I also agree Passive View is a good candidate if there is a lot of round-tripping between designer and developer, but would hope I could figure out something closer to Presentation Model if that scenario arose. :)

Thanks for reading and commenting,
Ben</description>

		<description>Hi Ben,
Thanks for putting these examples together for comparison between PM and PV. The code is easy to follow and the comments help me understand how Swiz works.

With Passive View, I personally wouldn&#039;t reach into the view&#039;s datagrid and buttons. I would stick to one dot and not violate the Law of Demeter. For example, I would move your Mediator&#039;s selectedEmployee() setter into the view. This would help you avoid the creepiness of digging around in the view&#039;s guts.

I like how super-clean the view code is. Like Troy, I have views created in Flash, so Passive View helps with designer/developer workflow.</description>
