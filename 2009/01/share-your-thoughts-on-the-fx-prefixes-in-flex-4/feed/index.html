		<description>The existing components are all in the mx: namespace why not create a new namespace like fx rather then adding fx to class names?  Who really is going to create an application with both the new and the old components at the same time anyway?  Namespaces would probably make migration easier as you can swap namespace and then correct all the errors where backwards compatibility is broken not have to go in and update every since component name.  The Fx prefix is such a lazy man&#039;s hack.</description>

		<description>Hi , nice initiative,
At some point, they got to understand the bad they&#039;ve done to the image of Flex. I&#039;m not anymore eager to read any docs or articles around Flex 4 since I&#039;m aware of that Fx peg leg.

Can we have access to some results ? or a read-only version of the spreadsheet behind the form ? (if it&#039;s possible with this google doc thing)
Because after validating our choices, we just have a &quot;thank you&quot; message.

... yes I know I&#039;m one of those damn impatients.

Regards,
dD</description>

		<description>I vote for ditching the Fx prefix, simply because it&#039;s counter-intuitive.

The ActionScript language and the Flex framework are very easy to learn, and very intuitive in terms of naming conventions.

We are now steering towards an even better Flex release named Gumbo, and though I understand there are concerns regarding backward compatibility, it seems a bit awkward that we should choose counterintuitive names just for the sake of an &quot;old&quot; (yet very common version).

I strongly vote for the use of namespaces to solve that problem. A developer should be able to use  if she intended to use the Gumbo button and  to use the Halo button. That&#039;s what namespaces are for, right?

Best regards
C.</description>

		<description>Hey Ben,

Great idea!  I am so on board with ditching the Fx prefixes.  But I really think the decision to include them is symptom of a greater problem. Had the community had input into the decision to do this, it never would have been done.  Very few people who understand why it was done agree with the decision.

We need to help Adobe create a community forum for discussing the implementation of features.  With our input things like this would not happen and beyond that the developers of the community could help offset the budget for development on the Flex SDK team.

But in the interest of being fair perhaps the form should allow people to show their support.  While I don&#039;t agree with the change, I believe in the community and for your statistics to be effective they have to show both sides of the argument.

Thanks for helping make some noise!</description>

		<description>Hi Thom,

You&#039;re right, I definitely geared it towards people that have a problem with the prefixes. My thinking, beyond the fact that removing them is what I am trying to accomplish, is that if you are for the prefixes your side is already winning. :) In other words, if nothing is done you&#039;ve gotten what you want since they are already in place.

Thanks,
Ben</description>

		<description>I don&#039;t like the survey.  I wanted to vote positively towards the Fx prefix, but there isn&#039;t really an option.</description>
