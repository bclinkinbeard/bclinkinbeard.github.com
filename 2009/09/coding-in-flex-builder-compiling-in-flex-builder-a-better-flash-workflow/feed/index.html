		<description>I think I worked it out!

Remember this is essentially a Flash project utilising FB solely for code development, so there cannot be any Flex code, just ActionScript.

Therefore I can&#039;t use New -&gt; Flex Project with the AIR radio button as it will add Flex code to the project.

However adding the AIR framework to the ActionScript project in Flex seemed to give FB the &quot;knowledge&quot; of the AIR code it was compiling, so no more errors.

I found the AIR framework (airglobal.swc) under Flash CS4/AIK 1.5/frameworks/libs/air/  in my Applications folder (Mac OSX).

I added airglobal.swc to the Library path in Flex found under:

[~myFlexProject] -&gt; Properties -&gt; ActionScript Build Path -&gt; Library Path

Seems to work!

I see what you&#039;re saying about the word &quot;timeline&quot; but really I&#039;m just using it as a class property, so I&#039;m not sure Flex thinks its a Flash timeline. Its the property nativeWindow which Flex didn&#039;t understand until the AIR framework was added.

Anyway thanks for a marvellous article which is by far the easiest I&#039;ve read on how to use FB for pure ActionScript development.</description>

		<description>Hi Andrew,

Flex Builder has a specific AIR project type. You would have to say New -&gt; Flex Project, and then in the dialog check the AIR radio button. There is (as far as I know) no concept or reference to the timeline in these projects so you would likely have to redo some code.

HTH,
Ben</description>

		<description>I&#039;m trying to get this workflow to work for a project that I started in Flash CS4. One difference is that in Flash the project is published as AIR 1.5.

Now that I&#039;ve brought the project into Flex Builder and set it up as an ActionScript project, FB does not seem to recognise the AIR specific code even when the correct Class is imported.

For instance, code that allows the application window to be dragged

Main.timeline.stage.nativeWindow.startMove ();
(timeline is a property of the Main Class and refers to the main timeline)

throws this error

1119: Access of possibly undefined property nativeWindow through a reference with static type flash.display:Stage.


even though the Class has this import:

import flash.display.*;

This code works correctly when using Test Movie in Flash.

Any ideas how I get FB to recognise this AIR specific code?</description>

		<description>You should not extend symbol classes unless it is to add behavior to them. In other words, only view classes should extend the symbol classes, not &quot;behavior and logic&quot; classes.</description>

		<description>What if you needed your behavior and logic classes to inherit from a base class? Since all of your logic classes are stuck extending &quot;dumb&quot; MovieClip symbols, you can never take advantage of logic-level OOP, right?  (Excluding hacks to simulate multiple inheritance.)</description>

		<description>(I should clarify that artists still need the UI classes in the method I use; just that those classes are totally bare bones and contain no implementation, they&#039;re more like UI interfaces.)</description>

		<description>I didn&#039;t mean that an artist couldn&#039;t compile out of the Flash authoring environment if they had all the right files, I just meant that with this method anyone that wants to compile has to have all the source code and such.

The benefit of the method I use (which I agree is a little counter-intuitive - code should be the parent!) is that our artists don&#039;t even have to have the source code anywhere on their machine. They can work totally independently, and make as many art changes as they want without even touching the code files - since their main art file has a small bootstrap that loads in the code, which then uses the parent definitions from the art SWF.

I&#039;ll make a post about it and let you know; it sounds really convoluted when I try to explain it briefly! We use GIT for our source control solution, and it&#039;s just better that artists don&#039;t have to have anything to do with code files, and developers don&#039;t have to have anything to do with art files. :P</description>

		<description>Our preferred workflow too when working with FlashDevelop - win in code completion, win in compilation time.

People complaining about the &quot;artist updates the SWC&quot; are just boring: if something has to be updated &quot;easily&quot; just keep it as an external SWF.</description>
