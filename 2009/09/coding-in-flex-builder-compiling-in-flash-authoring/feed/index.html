		<description>You can use the debugger in Flex Builder for apps compiled with the Flash IDE. Be sure to select &quot;Permit Debugging&quot; from the publish settings. You may want to unselect it for production as it does add to the size of the file. Check this link:

		<description>I&#039;m with Troy.  Compiling in Flash IDE is next to worthless without the Flex Debugger.  I use the debugger constantly as I&#039;m developing.  I hardly ever write trace statements anymore because of it.</description>

		<description>Hi John,

Can you explain what you mean by &quot;extend those SWCs&quot;? I am interested to hear more.

Thanks!

		<description>Lee Brimelow, Adobe, did a series on Pimp My Eclipse where it built a set of plugins for Eclipse &amp; the Flex Builder plugin that allowed you to test Flash from within Eclipse.    It works really well.  http://theflashblog.com/?cat=45

Like Troy, I&#039;ve started to get out of having Flash as my build environment.  I&#039;m using Flash to export SWCs of just the movieclip assets.  In an AS3 project, I then extend those SWCs to add any necessary logic for that assets.</description>

		<description>But what I want -- and I&#039;m still shocked that Adobe hasn&#039;t provided this out of the box yet -- is to use Flex Builder as my debugger (or profiler) as well. Why, Adobe, why can we not do this?

I&#039;ve fortunately avoided having to use the Flash authoring tool as my &quot;build environment&quot; (except for a few mini games -- and it was painful there as well). In fact, I&#039;ve gone as far as to completely develop a game inside of FB and then, once finished, build a FLA that references it (so that artists could later skin it).

The approach I&#039;ve ended up with that works best is treating Flash as just a vector animation and drawing tool, just like Photoshop/Fireworks for raster assets, loading or embedding the SWFs. It&#039;s a shame, because there&#039;s a lot of power when the artists and coders can properly work together, both inside their best tools. Maybe we&#039;ll see that finally with Flash Catalyst.</description>
