                    <div class="postcontent">
						<p>A couple of weeks ago, <a href="coding-in-flex-builder-compiling-in-flash-authoring/index.html">I posted</a> about a workflow I had devised that allowed me to utilize Flash library symbols but still write my code in Flex Builder. While Adobe apparently thinks this awkward hybrid approach <a href="http://www.flashmagazine.com/news/detail/adobe_flash_cs5_sneaks_from_fotb09/">qualifies as &#8220;integration&#8221;</a>, I thankfully discovered a better process just a day or so after my posting. I discovered the main concept of this better workflow from <a href="http://www.arpitonline.com/blog/2009/03/21/flex-builder-tip-use-swcs-for-image-assets-not-embed-metatags-for-pure-actionscript-projects/">Arpit Mathur&#8217;s blog</a>.</p>
<p>What it basically boils down to is using Flash authoring to create a SWC that you then use as a library in your ActionScript project in Flex Builder. Getting Flash authoring to generate a SWC is as simple as checking a box in the Publish Settings dialog.</p>
<p><img src="http://s82985.gridserver.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/exportSWC.png" alt="exportSWC" title="exportSWC" width="450" height="300" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-282" /></p>
<p>Then make your ActionScript project use the resulting SWC.</p>
<p><img src="http://s82985.gridserver.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/useSWC.png" alt="useSWC" title="useSWC" width="450" height="300" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-283" /></p>
<p>What you can then do is create ActionScript classes that extend the symbols in your Flash file. As long as you give your symbol a linkage name it will be available for extension (and will itself extend MovieClip by default), allowing you to add behaviors and logic using class-based ActionScript like developers expect and prefer to do. The convention I have settled on is to add &#8220;_Symbol&#8221; to the end of the class names specified in Flash authoring to make it completely clear where everything originates.</p>
<p><img src="http://s82985.gridserver.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/myButtonLinkage.png" alt="myButtonLinkage" title="myButtonLinkage" width="421" height="326" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-284" /></p>
<p>The other major advantage this approach has is that it renders the <a href="http://jessewarden.com/2008/06/designer-vs-developer-declaring-stage-instances.html">&#8220;Automatically declare stage instances&#8221; debate</a> irrelevant. You can let the designers leave this setting off and write bits of timeline code if they need to and your classes that extend their symbols will still work. Regardless if they are specified manually in class files for the symbols themselves or Flash generates the classes automatically, the children of your symbols (text fields, child movie clips, etc.) will all be available to your code.</p>
<p><img src="http://s82985.gridserver.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/myButtonClass.png" alt="myButtonClass" title="myButtonClass" width="423" height="136" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-285" /></p>
<p>With this simple structure of a symbol in Flash:</p>
<p><img src="http://s82985.gridserver.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/symbol.png" alt="symbol" title="symbol" width="300" height="275" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-286" /></p>
<p>You can write a class like this to control it.</p>
<p><script src='http://pastie.org/625467.js'></script></p>
<p>The result is a functioning button that allows the designer to use the expressive, proven tools in Flash authoring to create the graphical assets while allowing the developer to use the mature code editing environment of Flex Builder. This process has proven valuable and efficient over the last two weeks and it addresses the major shortcoming of my previous post. That was an inability to use a proper debugger, and it also lets the designer and developer work in parallel, both in the environment most familiar to them. It lets each tool and each team member do what they do best.</p>
<p>While I developed this workflow (not that its an original one by any means, just new to me) due to my assignment on a project that could not use Flex, I actually think it could be valuable in Flex projects as well. For views that are highly detailed and/or non-standard it may very well be easier to let your designer create them in Flash than it would be to create some crazy MXML file that carefully layers exported images and animations that you then try to wire up and orchestrate with code. Simply write a class that extends your designer&#8217;s symbol and manipulates it as needed.</p>
<p>To me this seems like the best kind of workflow available today by far, and so its really disappointing and frustrating to think Adobe may not be taking things a step further in their next releases. We don&#8217;t need or want Flash Builder to compile and run our projects in Flash authoring. What we need are workflows that allow us to use tools that do their job well and that we&#8217;re comfortable with, and that simplify the inevitable round tripping between design and development. Having Flash Builder trigger compiles in Flash authoring may sell more licenses to <a href="coding-in-flex-builder-compiling-in-flash-authoring/index.html">the uninformed</a>, but its a sad excuse for integration from a company that creates tools ranging from authoring to runtime.</p>

						<p>I started receiving this error in a Flex library project tonight and did some Google-ing. Thanks to a comment by <a href="http://www.heliereric.com/" onClick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/2009/09/flex-builder-error-the-project-properties-files-could-not-be-read/links/erichelier');">Eric Hélier</a> on <a href="https://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FB-21707" onClick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/2009/09/flex-builder-error-the-project-properties-files-could-not-be-read/links/bug');">this bug</a> I was able to quickly fix the issue.</p>
<p>Eric mentioned the marking of Flex SWCs as external, which I had recently done. In my case though, it seemed to be marking locale as external that messed things up. I deleted the following line from my .actionScriptProperties file and the error disappeared, and leaving the locale merged in does not seem to affect SWC size anyhow.</p>
<p><code>&lt;libraryPathEntry kind="1" linkType="2" path="${PROJECT_FRAMEWORKS}/locale/{locale}"/&gt;</code></p>
<p>I hope this helps somebody out of a jam, preferably late at night or right at crunch time. <img src='../../wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

						<h5>Nostalgia and complaining</h5>
<p>Years ago, before AS3 and Flex 2 were on the scene, I was a Flash developer. I dabbled in other things like PHP, JavaScript and the horrific &#8220;classic&#8221; ASP, but Flash development with AS2 was always more interesting to me. I worked with <a href="http://www.openfieldcreative.com/" onClick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/2009/09/coding-in-flex-builder-compiling-in-flash-authoring/links/ofc');">great</a> <a href="http://www.helloample.com/" onClick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/2009/09/coding-in-flex-builder-compiling-in-flash-authoring/links/ample');">designers</a> who of course used Macs, while me and the rest of the developers were on PCs. (Don&#8217;t worry, I use a Mac now.) In order to preserve the designers&#8217; fonts and hand crafted animations, we taught them how to assign linkage names to their symbols and would have them deliver a .swf to us that had nothing on the stage, allowing us to pull symbols out of the library as we needed. Using the fantastic <a href="http://www.mtasc.org/" onClick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/2009/09/coding-in-flex-builder-compiling-in-flash-authoring/links/mtasc');">MTASC</a> compiler and an editor like <a href="http://www.primalscript.com/" onClick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/2009/09/coding-in-flex-builder-compiling-in-flash-authoring/links/primalscript');">PrimalScript</a>, our class-based AS2 code would be injected into the designers&#8217; .swf, bringing the site/game/whatever to life. Ahh, those were the days.</p>
<p>Fast forward to last week when I was assigned to my first ever non-Flex AS3 project and discovered that developing like we used to in Flash (tying AS classes to library symbols) is pretty painful these days. Or at least it was for me, until I constructed a very convenient workflow that you can probably guess at based on the title of this post. Now, I should probably explain what I mean by painful. You can write your AS3 classes in Flash authoring, and the process is very straightforward; just create classes whose names match the symbol linkage names and you&#8217;re done. Just like AS2. However, Flash authoring&#8217;s code editor is absolutely abysmal. I mean, I knew it was bad, but I was actually shocked at how bad it is. It won&#8217;t even create import statements for you when you create properties! If you have used Flex Builder or any other decent editor for more than 10 minutes, this is completely unacceptable. You could also write your code in Flex Builder, save, switch to Flash authoring and then test movie or publish from there. Honestly though, do you really want to do that 500 times a day? Me neither.</p>
<p>So, what is this better way you ask? Well, we use one improvement that did come with Flash authoring&#8217;s support of AS3, which is the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flash/quickstart/external_files_as3/#section2" onClick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/2009/09/coding-in-flex-builder-compiling-in-flash-authoring/links/documentClass');">document class</a> construct. This means that you simply create a custom class to represent your application, make sure it extends <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/langref/flash/display/MovieClip.html">MovieClip</a>, and tell the .fla to use it. We don&#8217;t need any code at all in our .fla, unlike <a href="http://www.bit-101.com/blog/?p=857" onClick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/2009/09/coding-in-flex-builder-compiling-in-flash-authoring/links/bit101');">back in the day</a>. This essentially means that your custom class is your root timeline, and adding display objects to it is like adding them to the stage.</p>
<h5>Coding in Flex Builder</h5>
<p>Since I use a Mac, Flex Builder and <a href="http://fdt.powerflasher.com/" onClick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/2009/09/coding-in-flex-builder-compiling-in-flash-authoring/links/fdt');">FDT</a> are the only realistic options for AS3 editors, as far as I know. If you are on a PC, <a href="http://www.flashdevelop.org/" onClick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/2009/09/coding-in-flex-builder-compiling-in-flash-authoring/links/flashdevelop');">FlashDevelop</a> is also a great program. Now, Flex Builder allows you to create ActionScript projects. In contrast to a Flex project, I assumed an ActionScript would be devoid of any reference to Flex SDKs, but this is not the case. Your ActionScript project will still reference an SDK in the compiler settings and in the build path dialog, but that is OK. Since you don&#8217;t reference any Flex classes, you will not be pulling the framework into your .swf. I think it is only referenced so Flex Builder knows where to find mxmlc, but I am not completely sure. In order to use library symbols as class instances, you will need to create corresponding classes (that extend MovieClip) for them that match the name specified in the their linkage field. Whether you need to add custom code or not, the classes must exist in order for you to reference them in Flex Builder. To reference their properties, like child text fields or buttons I declare those properties in the class and <a href="http://jessewarden.com/2008/06/designer-vs-developer-declaring-stage-instances.html" onClick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/2009/09/coding-in-flex-builder-compiling-in-flash-authoring/links/jessewarden');">turn off &#8220;Automatically declare stage instances&#8221;</a> in the .fla&#8217;s publish settings.</p>
<h5>Compiling in Flash authoring</h5>
<p>OK, none of that was revolutionary but now comes the hard part. How do you compile/test your project without having to switch back to Flash every time? The first piece of the puzzle is to use the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flashcommand/" onClick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/2009/09/coding-in-flex-builder-compiling-in-flash-authoring/links/flashcommand');">flashcommand</a> Python script that <a href="http://www.mikechambers.com/blog/2004/02/20/flashcommand-flash-command-line-compiler-for-os-x/" onClick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/2009/09/coding-in-flex-builder-compiling-in-flash-authoring/links/mikechambers');">Mike Chambers posted</a> a long time ago. (It is only for OS X in its current state but I would assume creating a PC-friendly version wouldn&#8217;t be too hard.) All this really does is open Flash if necessary, and compile the .fla(s) you tell it to, by writing JSFL to a temporary file and then running a line of AppleScript to execute the JSFL code. That is really great, but switching to Terminal every time I want to compile is no better than switching to Flash. I needed something I could trigger from within Flex Builder, so I naturally turned to Ant. All you need is a super simple build file, like this:<br />
<script src='http://pastie.org/607458.js'></script></p>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<p>As you can see, it just sets up a couple of properties and asks Python to run the flashcommand script. The <code>-e</code> argument tells flashcommand to include <code>doc.exportSWF()</code> in the generated JSFL, which will publish the .swf to the location specified in the <code>-o</code> argument. If this is all you need to do, but want to then launch the newly created file in Flash Player, you can add the following to your build.xml file.<br />
<script src='http://pastie.org/609620.js'></script></p>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<p>That was my initial approach but it makes viewing your traces kind of a pain. The easiest way I found was to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_%28Unix%29" onClick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/2009/09/coding-in-flex-builder-compiling-in-flash-authoring/links/tail');">tail</a> your flashlog.txt file but that still kind of sucks. Its especially bad because a LOT of .swfs on the web still include trace statements, meaning your Terminal is flooded with statements generated by every banner ad running in your open browsers.</p>
<p>What I ended up doing was to edit flashcommand so that the <code>-e</code> argument also adds <code>fl.getDocumentDOM().testMovie()</code> to the generated JSFL, causing Flash authoring to execute a test movie action. I also added <code>activate</code> to the end of the generated AppleScript so that Flash&#8217;s test movie window would be brought into focus and ready for interaction. This allows you to use Flash&#8217;s built in Output panel to view your trace statements, and your trace statements only. (I tried making the test movie option a separate command line argument but couldn&#8217;t get it working correctly. If any Python hackers out there want to show me the way I&#8217;d be much obliged.)</p>
<p>Set up a keyboard shortcut in Flex Builder for running Ant and your workflow is almost identical to a Flex or code-only ActionScript project. Your .swf will be generated and published to whatever location you&#8217;ve specified, and will also be opened in Flash authoring for visual inspection and testing. I am probably not the first to come up with something like this, but I didn&#8217;t find any good links on the subject and other people expressed an interest in hearing about my workflow. If you have suggestions on further improvements (like how to use Flex Builder&#8217;s debugger for these projects) I would love to hear them. Regardless, I hope this is useful to other coders who find themselves needing to develop AS3 projects that associate custom classes with library symbols.</p>

						<p>As I <a href="../08/digging-into-flare/index.html">mentioned</a> in my last post, I have begun a project using the <a href="http://flare.prefuse.org/">Flare data visualization toolkit</a>, and I intend to document things I learn along the way. One of the first things I investigated, after familiarizing myself with the basics was how customizable the grids and axes for visualizations could be. It took me longer than I expected to figure things out, but now that I have I would say the grids and axes in Flare are highly customizable, and should be capable of accommodating just about any needs you may have.</p>
<p>This post is mostly code and images, but in case you want to jump around here is a table of contents.</p>

<h5><a name="bgInfo">Background info</a></h5>
<p>Before we dive in to the examples, I need to cover a tiny bit of background information and establish some constants we'll be using. First, all of the examples will be using this simple data source:</p>
<div class="syntax_hilite">
<div id="actionscript-1">

<p>As you can see, its just an array containing 3 elements who each have an <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> property. Next, we'll look at a bare bones plot chart built with Flare. The following is essentially the bare minimum of code required to create a visualization in Flare. The default visualization is a plot chart using circular shape renderers, which is fine for our purposes here. We'll be using this code as a basis for the code added/demonstrated through the rest of the post, but I won't be repeating it all every time. Lastly, remember that Flare visualizations are really just <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/langref/flash/display/Sprite.html">Sprites</a>, which means they cannot be added directly to Flex containers, only to <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/langref/flash/display/DisplayObjectContainer.html">DisplayObjectContainers</a>, which is also Sprite's super class. <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/langref/mx/core/UIComponent.html">UIComponent</a>, and therefore most every Flex component, are in fact descendants of Sprite, meaning you can add Sprites to UIComponents. For more information on Flash Player's core display classes, see <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=05_Display_Programming_03.html">this page</a>.</p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p>This code produces the following visualization:</p>
<p><img src="http://s82985.gridserver.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/flaregrid_01.png" alt="Default Flare grid" title="Default Flare grid" width="450" height="360" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-132" /></p>
<p>As you can see, the grid bounds are dynamically created based on the data being shown. This would be very convenient if that is what we wanted, but in my case it was not.</p>
<h5><a name="gridBounds">Controlling grid bounds</a></h5>
<p></p>
<p>If we'd like the chart's minimum values to always be zero, we can use the <code>zeroBased</code> property of the <code>xScale</code> and/or <code>yScale</code> properties of our <code>axisLayout</code>. The following code will cause both the x and y axis to begin at zero.</p>
<div class="syntax_hilite">
<div id="actionscript-3">
<div class="actionscript">axisLayout.<span style="color: #006600;">xScale</span>.<span style="color: #006600;">zeroBased</span> = <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">true</span>;<br />
axisLayout.<span style="color: #006600;">yScale</span>.<span style="color: #006600;">zeroBased</span> = <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">true</span>;</div>
</div>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>To control the maximum values of our chart we can use the <code>preferredMax</code> property.</p>
<div class="syntax_hilite">
<div id="actionscript-4">
<div class="actionscript">axisLayout.<span style="color: #006600;">xScale</span>.<span style="color: #006600;">preferredMax</span> = <span style="color: #cc66cc;">10</span>;<br />
axisLayout.<span style="color: #006600;">yScale</span>.<span style="color: #006600;">preferredMax</span> = <span style="color: #cc66cc;">10</span>;</div>
</div>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Note that there is a <code>preferredMin</code> property as well, but it (oddly) is ignored when set to zero. You can use it to set the lower bounds of your axes to any value other than zero. Adding the two snippets above has specified that our chart axes should begin at zero and end at 10, regardless of the data being shown. The resulting chart looks like this:</p>

<h5><a name="customizing">Customizing grids and axes</a></h5>
<p>
To really start customizing your chart, you'll want to use the <code>xyAxes</code> property of Flare's <a href="http://flare.prefuse.org/api/flare/vis/Visualization.html">Visualization</a> class. <code>xyAxes</code> is of type <a href="http://flare.prefuse.org/api/flare/vis/axis/CartesianAxes.html">CartesianAxes</a> and contains several convenient properties, as well as providing access to <code>xAxis</code> and <code>yAxis</code> properties that represent exactly what their names say, and are both of type <a href="http://flare.prefuse.org/api/flare/vis/axis/Axis.html">Axis</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe you want to eliminate the default grid pattern in favor of a simple bottom and left border.</p>
<div class="syntax_hilite">
<div id="actionscript-5">
<div class="actionscript"><span style="color: #808080; font-style: italic;">// effectively only hides top and right borders</span><br />

<p>This code produces the following chart:</p>
<p><img src="http://s82985.gridserver.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/flaregrid_04.png" alt="flaregrid_04" title="flaregrid_04" width="450" height="360" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-176" /></p>
<h5><a name="usefulMethods">Useful methods</a></h5>
<p>
There is also an <code>axisScale</code> property on the Axis class (our <code>xAxis</code> and <code>yAxis</code> elements). axisScale is typed as <a href="http://flare.prefuse.org/api/flare/scale/Scale.html">Scale</a>, but will usually be a <a href="http://flare.prefuse.org/api/flare/vis/data/ScaleBinding.html">ScaleBinding</a> instance as Scale is essentially an abstract class. Scale (or rather its subclasses) provide two very useful methods, <code>interpolate( value:Object ):Number</code> and <code>lookup( f:Number ):Object</code>. The interpolate method will return a number representing where on the scale the passed in value falls. In our example where our range is 0 to 10, 5 would return .5, 8 would return .8, etc. The lookup method essentially does the opposite, accepting a number and returning the corresponding value on the scale, meaning .5 would return 5 in our example, 2 would return 20, and so on. These methods can be extremely helpful if you need to do custom drawing on your chart, and are the kind of value translation methods that seem to be missing from the Flex charts.</p>
<h5><a name="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h5>
<p>
This is obviously not an exhaustive list of customizations possible with Flare, but it hopefully gives you an idea of the kinds of things you can do out of the box. I haven't decided which topic to cover next, so if there are specific questions or features people would like to see let me know in the comments.</p>
