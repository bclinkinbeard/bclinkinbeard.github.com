		<description>@Ben -Thanks for the nice article on Flare. 

I also recommend a new article &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gridlinked.info/using-flare-visualization-with-flex/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Using Flare Visualization with Flex&lt;/a&gt;&quot; which provides a detailed  overview for Flex developers, a video of a real-world solution, power tips, and sample code.</description>

		<description>Hi there, i was wondering if it were possible to get say an output of elements from say a mysql database and then use flare to arrange them around like in the icicle layout? i mean like dragging and dropping them into parents?</description>

		<description>Hi Charles,

I&#039;m glad it was helpful, thanks! Hopefully I will be blogging some more Flare stuff soon, it just depends on how my current project unfolds.

Thanks,
Ben</description>

		<description>Ben,

Just wanted to thank you for such a nice article.  I haven&#039;t found any other documentation on Flare covering these points.  You&#039;re inclusion of the preferredMax property got me on the right track to solve an issue I was having.

Great article!</description>

		<description>Hi David, my guess would be no, but I haven&#039;t tried. What I would suggest, which I have done before, is to layer multiple visualizations on top of each other. As long as you constrain the bounds of each of them identically, you should be able to make it look like a single chart.

Hope that helps,
Ben</description>

		<description>Thanks for the post.

Do you know if it is possible to add a second y axis so I can plot data at different units?  I looked through the documentation and it does not seem possible, but thought I would ask.

		<description>Not sure off the top of my head. I am not yet into Flare in any detail as my project is still in the planning stages. The first places I would look though are the ScaleBinding (maybe the bins or ordinals properties) and ScaleType classes.

HTH,
