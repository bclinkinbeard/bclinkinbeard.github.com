		<description>It&#039;s unfortunate how Flash does anti aliasing. This is an easy example to fix, just make sure you snap to whole pixels, but that in turn has side effects in animation. Easy enough to fix, just make sure you don&#039;t snap to pixels when animating, but that&#039;s brittle. Especially smaller vector details exhibit these kinds of issues, such as small text. Now that there&#039;s about a billion ways to render text in flash, it can be remedied but it&#039;s still a nuisance.</description>
