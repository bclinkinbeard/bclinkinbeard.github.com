		<description>I&#039;m not sure what you mean by Swiz having better native support for Signals than RobotLegs. The signals utility Joel put together is really just for being able to map a signal to a command, which you don&#039;t do here anyway. &quot;Natively&quot; in RobotLegs I could map a signal as a singleton instance and inject it into other classes in my app no problem.</description>

		<description>Nice. Was not aware you can config Swiz in as or mxml. 

If you can provide a post with example of command pattern with Swiz that would be great!</description>

		<description>Nice Ben, in further tweaking of Swiz/Signals/Robotlegs, I would have to agree that just dumping your signals in your beans with Swiz works out very nice. I always feel a little cleaner when I don&#039;t have instantiated Swiz&#039;s in my apps.</description>

		<description>Hey Troy,

I updated the post to show the same Swiz config defined in ActionScript.

As I mentioned, I think where Swiz surpasses RL is in terms of developer productivity, scalability and flexibility. As for the &quot;controller tier&quot;, there really isn&#039;t one unless you want it. You can very easily use the Command pattern with Swiz if you prefer it. Maybe I should post an example of that?

And finally, yea, stop being so petty. :)

		<description>I don&#039;t know why, but I still despise the left-over-Java nomenclature of &quot;bean provider.&quot; I know that&#039;s incredibly petty, but it drives me up the wall.

Very happy to see you added &quot;Inject&quot; alongside &quot;Autowire&quot;! ;-)</description>

		<description>Very cool. Definitely curious to see how Swiz is &quot;better&quot; than Robotlegs (because I&#039;m quite smitten with Robotlegs). Would be particularly interested to see the differences in terms of the controller tier (comamnds, etc.).

What would the AS3 equivalent of the above look like in Swiz? I&#039;ve held off on adopting Swiz because of it&#039;s MXML but it sounds as if you dual-support AS3/MXML now?</description>
