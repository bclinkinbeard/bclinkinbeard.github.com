		<description>Hey Thomas,

That&#039;s right, when bind is set to false Swiz will do a simple property assignment rather than attempting to create a binding. We have also made some tweaks recently. bind now defaults to false so you have to explicitly opt-in if you want a binding to be created. We also made Swiz smarter so that if you try to create a binding on a non-public property, we will log a warning.

HTH,
Ben</description>

		<description>Thx Ben.
With bind=false [as I understand it], that means that someProp is injected 1x only (or whenever addedToStage) is called. Right?</description>

		<description>Hey Thomas, we&#039;ve actually made progress since I wrote this post. Swiz now supports custom namespaces out of the box, on all metadata tags. [Inject], [Mediate], [PostConstruct], etc can all be defined on custom namespaced members. The only caveat is that if you are using bean property injection like [Inject( &quot;someBean.someProp&quot; )], you need to add bind=false to the tag if someProp is bindable. By default, Swiz will create a binding for you when injecting a bindable bean property. However, BindingUtils only works with public members, so we can&#039;t do that in that scenario.</description>

		<description>This is very nice. 

In some cases I used &quot;internal&quot; or a custom namespace to create non-public &quot;friend&quot; relationships between classes. [e.g. one class can access special non-public properties or methods of another since it is declared a &quot;friend&quot;].

With Swiz support for namespace injection, this is super cool!</description>

		<description>Hey Roland,

I squashed your comments into one.

Thanks for bringing this up! I had already seen this but thought I needed an actual Namespace object to construct the QName. As I see now, that is not the case. I will absolutely be integrating this functionality into [Inject] by default now. Thanks for making me take a second look!

		<description>Nice one Ben, examining the XML that describeType() returns I can see this:

&lt;variable name=”myProperty” type=”String” uri=”http://ns.myproject.org/custom_namespace”&gt;

So I&#039;m pretty sure the standard injection mechanism can be augmented to support custom namespaces by default.
I&#039;ll certainly make sure that as3commons-reflect will support the extra information.

cheers,

Roland</description>
