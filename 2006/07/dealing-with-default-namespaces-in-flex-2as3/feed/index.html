		<description>Hi Rahul, I tried getting rid of it also when I first started with Flex but never really followed through as the method described in the post works well enough for me. Only thing I can think of would be to maybe convert the XML to a String, strip out the namespace and then parse it back to XML.</description>

		<description>Hi there,
I am also a flex buff.. recently in one of my app, I used a webservice, which returned data in xml format. Well thats how u always get it.
But it had so many namespaces in its root tag. I managed to remove all of them except one which is default i.e. no prefix (xmlns:&quot;blahblah&quot;). I used removeNamespace() method on the xml object.

Will you suggest me one method to get rid of it?
As I am not able to break my xml code into pieces because of this namespace..
Thanks in advance</description>

		<description>Actually, this structure is good enough for Adobe as they use it in their framework :)

Within the framework, there are some methods/props namespaced to mx_internal.  This is because some api bits need to be accessible from other classes, so private and protected won&#039;t work, and they aren&#039;t meant to be public.  So they&#039;ve done the same thing...you&#039;ll find a file at mx/core/mx_internal.as which defines the namespace for mx_internal and then call:

use namespace mx_internal

whenever things in that namespace need to be accessed.</description>
