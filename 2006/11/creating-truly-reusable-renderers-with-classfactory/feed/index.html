		<description>Hi Ben

Great Article!! It really helped me in solving one of complex problem in my project where I am required to build a dynamic grid with variable no of columns and apply one generic item renderer to apply across all of them.</description>

		<description>Ah, I am doing it as a component in an existing mxml file, since I won&#039;t need this component outside of this module. Is it possible to do it this way, or do I need to create a separate class?</description>

		<description>Hi Paul,

The class you&#039;re using as your renderer needs to implement the interface. So your class definition should look like public class MyRenderer implements IListItemRenderer { .... }

HTH,
Ben</description>

		<description>Pardon my ignorance,  but I am not sure what you mean when you say &quot;If you implement ILIstItemRenderer &quot; If that is what you get by default when you specify the itemRenderer property on a mx:DataGridColumn, then I have implemented it.

I have breakpointed the code while in a function called from the item renderer, and was unable to find any variables similar to the ones you describe. For fun I tried trace(data.owner) and it returns undefined.

Thanks for the quick response btw.</description>

		<description>Hi Paul,

If you implement ILIstItemRenderer you will have a listData property that gets automatically set for you. When inside a DataGrid it will be an instance of DataGridListData which contains properties like rowIndex, columnIndex and owner (the DG). Thats all from memory so exact names might be a bit off.

		<description>The one thing I need that I am not sure this will do for me, but perhaps you might help, is to know what datagrid and row I was called from, I have an itemrenderer that is used in a tabbed form with multiple datagrids. In certain cases when the user clicks a check box I need to do different things based on which datagrid they are in.

Any ideas?</description>

		<description>Thanks Ben
But for my case I have to use the nested datagrid; there are some design issues block me for making a use of the advancedatagrid .

if you can tell me how should the ItemRenderer Class looks like, this will be great and appreciated.

May thanks in advance.</description>

		<description>Hi Mohammad,

While this is technically possible I would strongly recommend against it. You will likely run into performance issues very quickly and I also don&#039;t think it would make for a good user experience to try and decipher nested grids. Perhaps look into the AdvancedDataGrid which allows you to selectively expand and collapse rows.

HTH,

		<description>Great Article.
I&#039;m new to Flex3 and I have a question for you and I hope u own the answer ..
I want to add a datagrid as ItemRenderer to another main Datagrid ( in other words, nested datagrids).

how should the ItemRenderer Class looks and how to set the dataprovider to the of the sub-Datagrid .

Thanks in advance ..</description>
