		<description>You are right. I have the same dilemma in the past. Now I have 29 years old and work with SAP BW. I´m a senior consultant and the time that and money that I don´t spent for a degree I use for my personal improvement.

The word is = TALENT. If you had it, don´t worry.

good lucky !

		<description>U.S. News has an annual listing of the &quot;best&quot; schools in various categories.  I would use this as a starting point but I would not trust it as the de facto standard,
I worked for a major university for several years and the rankings are quite important to them, I will go so far to say that they operate to increase the ranking more so than the quality of the education.
For example they may take candidates only with scores above a certain level because they want to show a high average score, even though more qualified lower scoring candidates are left out.  And my favorite, the percentage employed within x days after graduation.  Many graduates may find themselves working for the university after graduation until they find a good job a year down the road, this way the university can say 99% are employed within x days.
Go for the school that offers you the best compliment to what you want to get out of graduate school.  Choose one that is in a good area or one close by, the commute will be an annoyance after a while, especially if your experience is lacking in substance.  Also I would consider degree options that offer a wider base of topics, not just one subject.  An MBA with a focus in high-tech. may be a option, this gives you the ability to move up further in a company rather than just an engineering degree.  Also captures more of that networking opportunity.   Good luck.</description>

		<description>Thanks Lar, some great points there. While I&#039;ve always viewed MIT as pretty much the pinnacle of technology-related education, there are a host of reasons I cannot attend graduate school there. The two biggest would probably be my lack of superhuman intelligence and the 15 hour commute. :) Do you know of any good resources that provide rankings of graduate schools for specified fields of study?</description>

		<description>If your employer is going to pay for 90% of it then do it.  A Masters degree will open doors for you in the future, just for having it even though the actual studies may not.  Depending on your degree you should also be aware that going back for a Masters is also a huge networking opportunity.  You will meet a lot of people that could develop into your next employers, co-workers, or staff.
I went back more than than ten years ago and got an MBA, the education was good but the networking paid off.  Next spring I begin another Masters degree, so I can speak from experience and having gone through some of the same questions.
Last thing about graduate school is the good school vs. mediocre school question.  If you can get into one of the top tier schools like MIT or Stanford it makes a difference otherwise all the other schools are going to teach you the same thing.  If you do not get into top tier school go to the one that is in the area where you want to live because that is were the networking will happen.  Hope this helps, good luck.</description>

		<description>Hi Barry,

Not necessarily CompSci, but if it were something else it would probably be something like IS or something else that combines tech and business. I doubt I will want to write code until I retire, but I definitely want to for the next 5 to 10 years. During that time I would hope to continue moving up the tech ladder to do things like system/product architecture and other more &#039;big picture&#039;, design related tasks. Who knows after that but as far as I can tell I want to be involved in technology related work for the duration of my career.</description>

		<description>Not questioning the idea of a masters degree at all (sometimes ppl are so busy doing and keeping up, formal quals get pushed to the back - and stay there...)

just curious: are you sure you want to get a CompSci one? Sure it&#039;d make you a better programmer - but is that what you want to do for the next 10 years of your life?

if it is, go for it - more power to you. There&#039;s enough new stuff coming on that you could riding the crest of that wave for a long  - and profitable - career.

Me? I&#039;m looking at masters in Education. I don&#039;t want to cut code for the rest of my life...</description>

		<description>Thanks for the input Matt, I really appreciate it. I have looked at a few IS-related programs too for the very reasons you mention. I probably should have titled the post &quot;Should I get a Master’s degree? (and if yes, in what?)&quot; but that seemed a bit wordy. :)</description>

		<description>I mulled this very question over quite a bit when I got out of music and started doing programming full time. I got a Master of Science in Computer Information Systems, I paid for it myself, and I haven&#039;t regretted it one bit. I think a lot of employers do see this as something that shows you&#039;ve gone the extra mile, and honestly I learned a lot of just basic business and management &quot;stuff&quot; that I probably wouldn&#039;t have learned any other way. It&#039;s not just about the technical stuff--anyone can learn that as you point out. It&#039;s about learning how to think about things more holistically than you might if you&#039;re neck-deep in code all day every day.

For learning more technical stuff the value of a Master&#039;s might be a bit questionable (depending on the courses for the particular degree), but for learning more than just tech stuff I found it extremely valuable. Don&#039;t discount the courses that you think might be of no interest to you or irrelevant--you never know what you&#039;re going to get out of something and how you might apply it in the future.</description>
