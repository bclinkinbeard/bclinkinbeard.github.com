		<description>This is a great component. 

&gt;&gt; Changing the focus from one window to another is too slow..

How can we make changing focus faster? What events can be disabled to make it faster?

Thanks!

		<description>Hello ben,

Dont mind, I figured out how to use flexMDI I did following
(it is just for newcomers like me who can get started fast)

1&gt; Extract the FlexMDI to some folder.
2&gt; In ur project add .swc to lib path in Project properites
3&gt; Enjoy this awesome component and say thanks to these
     Kind and talented developers.

Well before i end this how to I would like to thank all the development
team of this awesome component. I will post my findings and suggestions soon. BTW I am thinking like a desktop database application developer and evaluating this in that perspective.

I would like to take my desktop delphi database application to
Web with Flex Bulder and FlexMDI will be the starting point since
my desktop application uses many forms which need to be
simultaneously open at a time and user should be able to switch between then easily.

Thanks and Best regards.

		<description>Thanks. It looks like I can do





with no problems. But if I say the following (identical correct imports etc.) I get a runtime 1065 (can&#039;t find DataGridView at getDefinitionByName). I can&#039;t imagine this is a problem with extending MDIWindow:

public class MDIDataWin extends MDIWindow
{
	public var component:String = &quot;com.fa.mdi.views.DataGridView&quot;;

	public function addDataGrid( _mdiCanvas:MDICanvas ):void
	{
		var cls:Class = getDefinitionByName( component ) as Class;
		var instance:UIComponent = new cls();

		var win:MDIWindow = new MDIWindow();
		win.width = 350;
		win.title = &quot;Data Grid&quot;;

		_mdiCanvas.windowManager.addCenter( win );
		win.addChild( instance );
	}
}</description>

		<description>I&#039;m trying to do something very simple: In response to an event I want to add a view defined in MXML. In my case this is an empty DataGrid. If I
say

public class MDIDataWin extends MDIWindow
	{

		public function addDataGrid( _mdiCanvas:MDICanvas ):void
		{
			var win:MDIWindow = new MDIWindow();
			win.width = 350;
			win.title = &quot;Data Grid&quot;;

			_mdiCanvas.windowManager.addCenter( win );
			win.addChild( DataGridView);
		}
	}

I get a coercion error as DataGridView is a class and addChild needs a display object. Any simple way to remedy this? I have many such custom views I&#039;ve created for reuse. Obviously I&#039;m missing something.
TIA.</description>

		<description>Hi Patrick,

FlexMDI utilizes the Flex component lifecycle and several Flex framework classes, so I don&#039;t really think porting it would be very easy. I&#039;ve not done any component development for Flash so I wouldn&#039;t even know where to begin.

Sorry,
Ben</description>

		<description>Great work!
However its sad to see that its only available for the Flex community.
Any plans or tips on how to make it on Flash AS3?
Thanks in advance!</description>
