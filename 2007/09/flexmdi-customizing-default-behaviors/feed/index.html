		<description>Hi

I want MDI window to resize horizontally only. I do not want to resize vertically when we drag window with the mouse.

I have the following function. This is eventListener for 
addEventListener(MDIWindowEvent.RESIZE,onWindowResize);

protected function onWindowResize(event:Event):void
{
	if( event is MDIWindowEvent)
	{
		var mdiEvent:MDIWindowEvent = event as MDIWindowEvent;
		if(mdiEvent.window.height&gt;534)
		{
			mdiEvent.stopImmediatePropagation();
			
		}	
	}
}

How to achieve this?

Thanks</description>

		<description>I eventually solved my problem by adding a CLOSED event to the FlexMDI source. When my window is officially &quot;CLOSED&quot; my listener function to unload the module is triggered and not before. If not using the Alert prompt, &quot;CLOSE&quot; will work, otherwise the module is destroyed before the user can decide. Trivial as that may seem it makes a big difference. Do I make sense now? :)</description>

		<description>Hi Veena,

Wordpress stripped out your code so I am not sure what you&#039;re trying. Don&#039;t forget though, Flash Player&#039;s garbage collection runs at unpredictable intervals. It will generally run in response to memory allocation, so removing references to an item does not mean it will be immediately removed from memory.

HTH,
Ben</description>

		<description>Hi.. This is quite interesting article.

I have a similar kinda situation where I am creating Flex MDI window and checking for users confirmation before closing it. My logic seems to be working as expected. But one interesting thing here is, when close event is fired, I find the window getting closed but not getting unloaded from the memory. I wrote a simple code as shown below and was checking the profiler to check if the closed window was referenced in memory or not.








		&lt;!-- Place non-visual elements (e.g., services, value objects) here --&gt;
















You input is greatly appreciated.</description>

		<description>Hi Ben,

I just want to say firstly, thank you for such an excellent toolkit.

I&#039;ve currently implemented you MDI Windows to load modules at runtime. This works as expected.
The problem I am experiencing is related to the Alert prompt. I have a listener on the window instance that I assume triggers when the &quot;close&quot; button is clicked but really should be triggered when the Alert prompt &quot;Yes&quot; is clicked. (  windowedModule.addEventListener(MDIWindowEvent.CLOSE, onMDIWindowClose); )

Each time I &quot;close&quot; a window I need to &quot;unload&quot; the module automatically but If I click &quot;close&quot; and the Alert box comes up and I click &quot;NO&quot; the module is still unloaded which shouldn&#039;t happen. I can&#039;t seem to get my head around this problem. Shouldn&#039;t there be a &quot;MDIWindowEvent.CLOSED&quot; event too. I think the &quot;MDIWindowEvent.CLOSE&quot; fires once the &quot;close&quot; button is triggered and not necessarily when the actual window is closed or exiting. Your advice would be most appreciated.</description>

		<description>Hi, I&#039;m developing an Air application and I&#039;m using the excellent MDI System, but I can&#039;t figure how to change the default right mouse menú. I mean how to add/remove events and translate the default labels (my application is in spanish).

Thank you in advance</description>
