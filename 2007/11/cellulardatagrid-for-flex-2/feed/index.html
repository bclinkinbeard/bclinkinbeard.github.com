		<description>Hi

Fantastic. Does anyone know how to do this in Flash as3?
As far as I can see it&#039;s only possible to return the row selected not individual cells.

This would solve a big head ache for me.

Thanks

		<description>Hi Thu,

I do see the behavior you mentioned, thanks for catching that. Unfortunately I am swamped right now and don&#039;t really have time to investigate. If I can find some time and fix it I will be sure to let you know.

Thanks,
Ben</description>

		<description>This has been very useful for what I am trying to do with my project. One thing I noticed is that when you select a cell and start to scroll up/down, the selected cell is now another cell randomly. It seems like this is the issue with cell rendering being recycled? Any suggestions? Thanks.</description>

		<description>The fix for the highlight moving appears to be
for each (var sp:Sprite in selectionIndicators ){
    sp.graphics.clear();
}
as the first thing in selectItem()</description>

		<description>very cool. One think I noticed though is if you select a cell in the same row as the currently selected cell, the previously selected one&#039;s highlight doesn&#039;t get removed until you move the mouse off that row.</description>
