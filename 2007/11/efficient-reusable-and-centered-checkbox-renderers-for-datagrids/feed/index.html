		<description>Just add the property &quot;rendererIsEditor&quot;. This makes your Renderer act as Editor when user click on the check box. So that theu00a0Check boxu00a0wontu00a0disappear.</description>

		<description>The labelPlacement property will force the button to center horizontally if you set it to &quot;top&quot; or &quot;bottom&quot;, so if you don&#039;t need a vertically centered renderer, you could simplify the class even further by just setting this property in your subclass or by using the plain CheckBox as a ClassFactory.

Additionally, DataGridColumn supports an editorDataField property so that you don&#039;t need to override the click handler to make this work if you only need it in DataGrid.</description>

		<description>Dear Ben,

Thanks for your CheckBox render. I have used it in my project. However, I found that if the row height was more than two lines, the updateDisplayList function does not work properly. I modified the updateDisplayList function of CenteredCheckBoxItemRenderer as follows, then it works fine:

if (!(c is TextField))
{
       c.x = (w - c.width) / 2;
       c.y = 0;
       ^^^^^^^^^^
}

However, I have another problem that if the datagrid reload data from its data provider and the head was selected already, then the items of the DataGrid will unselected but the head remain selected. How do I fix this?

Thanks a lot.</description>

		<description>Hi Ben,

Your code seems to be just what I need but there is one problem that I don&#039;t know how to overcome.

On my first attempt to adapt the code to my application, I introduced a combobox to filter the datagrid provider and after filtering some rows, I clicked on the checkbox header to check/uncheck all rows, but doing that it would simply check/uncheck some of them !.

Any suggestions as to how I can resolve this while using your checkbox code?

Thanks in advance.

		<description>Hi Bob,

Reading through it now there are a few things I wish I had explained better in the article. The only real difference between mine and Alex&#039;s renderer is that mine automatically sets the value in your dataProvider to true or false, based on the selected state of the CheckBox. You will definitely want to keep editable set to false, but you can still get notifications when values change. As I mentioned in the article, the click event will still bubble up, so you could easily listen for MouseEvent.CLICK, check to make sure event.target is a CenteredCheckBoxItemRenderer, and then take any appropriate action.

Hope that helps, let me know if its still not clear.

		<description>Hi Ben,
Your code seems to be just what I need but there is one issue that I don&#039;t know how to overcome.

On my first attempt to adapt the code, I found that when I clicked on a checkbox instead of checking/unchecking it, it would simply display the underlying value, e.g. false. My datagrid was set to editable=&quot;true&quot;. In order to make the checkbox code work as expected I found that I had to set either the datagrid or the checkbox column to editable=&quot;false&quot; . But doing that means that I can no longer access an itemEditEnd event.

I need to take certain actions based on changes to datafields. Any suggestions as to how I can do that while using your checkbox code?

Thanks
