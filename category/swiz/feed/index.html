			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The vaunted, venerable and value-laden 360|Flex conference is coming to Washington D.C. in a few weeks, and you really should be there. This will be my fifth 360 event in total, and my third time speaking, and I can honestly say I&#8217;ve never had less than an awesome time at the event. Regardless of your skill set/level, position on your career path or otherwise, if you are part of the Flex community or wish you were, 360|Flex is the place be. For the incredibly reasonable price of <a href="http://www.360flex.com/register/">$599</a>, you get no less than the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>One full day of hands on Flex-related training</li>
<li>Three full days of outstanding Flex-related sessions</li>
<li>Ample networking time and opportunities with the brightest minds and biggest names in the Flex industry</li>
<li>Three (I think) parties with those same Flex industry folk and your fellow attendees</li>
<li>Catered lunch each day of the conference</li>
<li>A prime opportunity to enhance your career path through gained knowledge and contacts</li>
</ul>
<p>Just browse the <a href="http://www.360flex.com/speakers/">speaker list</a>, and you&#8217;ll see there is no hyperbole in my statements above. Check out the <a href="http://360flex.com/downloads/schedule.pdf">session schedule (PDF)</a> to see the topics being covered, and I bet you&#8217;ll be hard pressed to find a slot that doesn&#8217;t have at least one session that appeals to you.</p>
<p>360|Flex really is like the family reunion of the Flex industry. Come join the family. <a href="http://www.360flex.com/register/">REGISTER!</a></p>
<p>Oh yea, I will be giving a session on Swiz that introduces the framework and shows developers how to get up and running quickly, and how Swiz can help you be more productive writing code. I hope to see you there!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update: </strong> Swiz now supports custom namespaces automatically, so this post is fairly irrelevant. For more info see the <a href="http://swizframework.jira.com/wiki/display/SWIZ/Release+Notes">Swiz RC1 release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Every now and then someone expresses frustration with the fact that Swiz, and every other Flash Platform dependency injection solution I know of, can only inject into public members. I started thinking about it yesterday and figured it actually wouldn&#8217;t be that hard to use a custom namespace rather than public. Granted, it&#8217;s not as nice as being able to use private members, but the Flash Player/AVM simply does not allow for that at this time. So tonight I spent about 15 minutes throwing together a proof of concept using Swiz 1.0&#8242;s new custom processor feature. What you see here is the result of that 15 minutes.</p>
<p>The first step was to create a custom namespace.<br />
<script src="http://gist.github.com/335930.js?file=gistfile1.as"></script></p>
<p>Then I created a view that defined some properties in that namespace.<br />
<script src="http://gist.github.com/335932.js?file=gistfile1.as"></script></p>
<p>I then created the custom processor to handle those special <code>[NSInject]</code> tags you see in the view. Subclassing Swiz&#8217;s built in InjectProcessor (which handles the standard [Inject] tags) allowed me to override just one simple method to accomplish my goal.<br />
<script src="http://gist.github.com/335934.js?file=gistfile1.as"></script></p>
<p>That&#8217;s it. It supports both property injection and setter injection, and has a ton of room for improvement. You could easily expand this to support the definition of specific namespaces in the metadata tag, or to read the namespace from the property, or some other enhancement I haven&#8217;t thought about. Remember, this was 15 minutes of coding; it has taken me longer to write this post than it did to create the processor and example app.</p>
<p>The ability to extend Swiz with custom processors is revealing itself to be an incredibly powerful feature. I fully believe it will turn out to be far more powerful than we even anticipated when we created it. We&#8217;ve not even released the 1.0 final version and people have already created processors related to <a href="http://www.riaspace.net/2009/12/logprocessor-custom-metadata-processor-for-swiz-1-0-0/">logging</a>, loading <a href="http://soenkerohde.com/2010/03/swiz-yahoo-finance-metadata-processor/">Yahoo Finance data</a>, and <a href="http://blog.foomonger.com/2010/02/26/swiz-signals-and-mediatesignal/">mediating AS3 Signals</a>.</p>
<p>What can you build?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://github.com/robertpenner/as3-signals">AS3-Signals</a> is a recent project by <a href="http://robertpenner.com/flashblog/">Robert Penner</a> as an alternative to Flash Player&#8217;s native event system. While I don&#8217;t personally have (m)any problems with events, I have been curious about Signals and keeping an eye out for an opportunity to try it, especially in conjunction with <a href="http://swizframework.org/">Swiz</a>. That opportunity presented itself a few weeks ago, when <a href="http://joelhooks.com/">Joel Hooks</a> finally showed <del>me</del> the world that Robotlegs <a href="http://joelhooks.com/2010/01/16/robotlegs-image-gallery-example-using-as3-signals-and-the-presentation-model/">can be used</a> without extending framework classes all over the place. As he says in the post, I had been asking to see that for a long time, because I cringe at frameworks that mandate lock-in via inheritance.</p>
<p>In looking at Joel&#8217;s sample application (which I think is very good), I noticed that it was very similar to a Swiz application. The application is configured using a context class, which is virtually equivalent to a Swiz instance used to configure an area of a Swiz application (or a whole application). So I spent about 15 minutes and took the latest Swiz SWC I had, created a Swiz instance that mapped to his context, put it in the context&#8217;s place, and voila; I had the same application running on top of Swiz. Literally the only other thing I had to do was to add a single [PostConstruct] metadata tag. You can see the striking similarities below. <strong>Edit:</strong> I have now also included the same Swiz configuration as it would look in ActionScript.</p>
<p><strong>Swiz config in MXML</strong><br />
<script src="http://gist.github.com/301114.js?file=ImageGallerySwiz.mxml"></script><br />
<strong>RobotLegs config</strong><br />
<script src="http://gist.github.com/301114.js?file=ImageGalleryContext.as"></script><br />
<strong>Swiz config in ActionScript</strong><br />
<script src="http://gist.github.com/305648.js?file=ImageGallerySwizAS.as"></script></p>
<p>You can even take the resulting application and switch the framework it&#8217;s running in by simply commenting/uncommenting the ImageGallerySwiz and ImageGalleryContext lines in index.mxml</p>
<p><a href="../../../swiz/examples/SwizSignals/index.html">Application</a> :: <a href="../../../swiz/examples/SwizSignals/srcview/index.html">Source</a></p>
<p>Working with Signals couldn&#8217;t be simpler, and Swiz supports them right out of the box. In fact, I couldn&#8217;t help but be amused by the fact Swiz had better native support for them than RobotLegs did. <img src='../../../wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  They are simply defined in a BeanProvider like any other dependency, and then work as expected. The [PostConstruct] I added was on LoadGalleryCommand&#8217;s execute() method, and it replaces the last line of ImageGalleryContext&#8217;s startup() method.</p>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>I really like the fact that applications can be somewhat interchangeable between the two frameworks now that we&#8217;ve settled on <code>[Inject]</code>. I think a reasonable degree of portability is a sign of a good framework, and based on this example you can see that both RobotLegs and Swiz meet that criteria. The obvious question then, is why pick one over the other? Some of it surely comes down to personal preference, but beyond that I think it is a question of power, scalability, adaptability and developer productivity. In future posts, I will show how Swiz is the clear winner in those categories. <img src='../../../wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PassiveScreen.html">Passive View</a> is another presentation pattern that can be used to increase the testability of graphical applications. It does this primarily by extracting all logic and state from your views, making it pointless to test the view itself. In fact, in the article linked above, Martin Fowler says the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>With the view reduced to a dumb slave of the controller, you run little risk by not testing the view.</p></blockquote>
<p>You instead test the component to which the logic and state have been extracted. This component can be referred to by names such as mediator, presenter or controller but the name itself is irrelevant. What is important is that it is not a view component (meaning it does not exist on the display list, in Flash/Flex specific terms), which are inherently hard to unit test. In the example application I have created I refer to these components as mediators.</p>
<h5>Example Application</h5>
<p>For this post I have simply converted the <a href="http://swizframework.org/">Swiz</a> <a href="../../../2009/05/swiz-example-application-with-presentation-model-pattern/index.html">example application</a> I created using the Presentation Model pattern. The conversion took maybe 30 minutes, which includes looking up some of the specifics of the pattern, because I had not actually implemented it before.</p>
<p><a href="../../../swiz/examples/PassiveView/index.html">Application</a> :: <a href="../../../swiz/examples/PassiveView/srcview/index.html">Source</a></p>
<h5>Motivations</h5>
<p>One of Swiz&#8217;s biggest strengths is the flexibility it affords you when using it. Rather than enforcing (or even suggesting) a particular architecture, it provides tools and utilities that help you to create well architected applications. I think showing the same application built with different (albeit similar) presentation patterns demonstrates this point quite well. I will also admit that I was influenced by the <a href="http://wiki.github.com/robotlegs/robotlegs-framework/best-practices">RobotLegs Best Practices document</a> in selecting Passive View as the pattern to demonstrate since they demonstrate/promote the pattern there. Hell, I will even admit there was a bit of &#8220;anything you can do, we can do better&#8221; sentiment on my part. <img src='../../../wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  That is not meant to take anything away from the RobotLegs team as they are certainly a smart bunch of guys, but I wouldn&#8217;t have joined the Swiz team if I didn&#8217;t think it was the best thing out there.</p>
<h5>Thoughts on Passive View</h5>
<p>I sort of like that your views become plain MXML with no logic, state or external references whatsoever when using the Passive View pattern. What I don&#8217;t like is what your mediator/presenter/controller becomes in order to purge your view of those things. I feel like you end up with a frankenstein class that is part (presentation) model, part controller and part code behind.</p>
<p>It is not truly code behind since it uses composition rather than inheritance, but it feels the same. You are reaching into the view to add listeners to its child components, setting properties directly on its child components, etc. Handling events from those child components is like a controller, but you also end up storing some state for the view as well. You could obviously break that out into a separate model class but for most views that is going to be massive overkill. I suppose that presentation models are or can be somewhat of a controller and model combination as well too though. I think adding all the knowledge of the view and its internals is what creeps me out most.</p>
<p>I also feel like Passive View fights against the platform a bit. Since the view has no references to anything, binding is not an option. The view can only be updated by user interaction or manually from the mediator, and even for the extremely simple example I created this felt very tedious. I also wonder if testing the mediator could not potentially be complicated by needing an instance of the view it mediates for operation. <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexunit/FlexUnit">Flex Unit 4</a> likely overcomes much of what would have been painful in the past in this area, but I feel like removing view components from the testing process completely is ideal.</p>
<p>In summary, I think Passive View is a decent pattern, but I won&#8217;t be abandoning Presentation Model to use it. In my opinion the drawbacks outweigh the benefits, but the same may not hold true for your particular needs and/or preferences.</p>
<h5>Further reading</h5>
<p>Be sure to read the Martin Fowler piece linked at the beginning of this post (and anything else by Fowler you have time for), and for another example of the Passive View pattern in Flex check out <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/paulw/archives/2007/11/presentation_pa_6.html">Paul Williams&#8217; post</a> on the topic.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About a month ago I was introduced to the <a href="http://swizframework.googlecode.com/">Swiz</a> application framework for Flex. Within an hour or so, I was not only sold on the simplicity and effectiveness of the framework, I was digging around in the source adding features. Shortly after that I started collaborating more closely with <a href="http://cdscott.blogspot.com/">Chris Scott</a>, creator of Swiz and a coworker of mine, and <a href="http://soenkerohde.com/">Sönke Rohde</a>, the other Swiz team member. The three of us have been cranking away adding new features ever since and have a lot planned for the coming months.</p>
<p>Now that introductions are out of the way, let&#8217;s look at some code. I&#8217;m really not going to try and explain much of anything here because I&#8217;ve done that (heavily) in the code and comments of the application. In the recent past I have repeatedly found myself frustrated with a lack of examples when reading about new frameworks or projects people are promoting. I learn best and quickest when I can see something in action and figure out how it works, so I created this example for other people like me. If you have questions, comments or suggestions about the application you can obviously post them here, or you can post them in the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/swiz-framework">Swiz Google Group</a> where I will also be posting a link.</p>
<p>Lastly, a couple of disclaimers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Only the Employees view of the application contains anything. I only created multiple tabs to facilitate the mode monitor at the bottom of the app.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve placed the ASDocs above the metadata tags for the sake of readability and simplicity. In a real application the ASDocs (unfortunately) go between the metadata and the code.</li>
</ul>
