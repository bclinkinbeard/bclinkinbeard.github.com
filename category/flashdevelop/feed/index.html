			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past week or so I have been fortunate enough to get to help out the guys from <a href="http://www.flashdevelop.org/">FlashDevelop</a>, as they added <a href="http://www.flashdevelop.org/community/viewtopic.php?t=806">support for AS3</a>. This has been really fun so far. Even though I have not used FlashDevelop very much, my limited exposure to it along with ringing <a href="http://www.flashmagazine.com/1243.htm">endorsements</a> from some <a href="http://www.timwalling.com/2006/03/09/flashdevelop-rc1-released/">well</a> <a href="http://www.bit-101.com/blog/?p=849">known</a> and respected Flash developers makes it obvious that it is a great editor with a very bright future. This is reinforced by the talented, enthusiastic and very responsive people behind the program, and my hat certainly goes off to them for implementing a feature requested by the community so quickly.</p>
<p>This work gave me a chance to finally try my hand at C# and to dig deeper into regex than I&#8217;ve dared before. Thanks to <a href="http://www.ultrapico.com/Expresso.htm">Expresso</a> and some knowledgeable, helpful co-workers it was quite a positive experience. I am really looking forward to continuing to work on this.</p>
<p>Anyhow, rather than crud up my main page every time there is an update to announce, I have created a <a href="../../../fdas3/index.html">page</a> devoted to my tiny piece of the pie. I would expect that any new developments (like Javadoc info) will be announced on the FD site, but the instrinsic class files will always reside in the same place. Unless they move. But they probably won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Now go <a href="http://www.flashdevelop.org/community/viewforum.php?f=11">try FlashDevelop</a>! I know I&#8217;m gonna <img src='../../../wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
