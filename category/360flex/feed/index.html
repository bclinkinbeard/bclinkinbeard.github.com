			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The vaunted, venerable and value-laden 360|Flex conference is coming to Washington D.C. in a few weeks, and you really should be there. This will be my fifth 360 event in total, and my third time speaking, and I can honestly say I&#8217;ve never had less than an awesome time at the event. Regardless of your skill set/level, position on your career path or otherwise, if you are part of the Flex community or wish you were, 360|Flex is the place be. For the incredibly reasonable price of <a href="http://www.360flex.com/register/">$599</a>, you get no less than the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>One full day of hands on Flex-related training</li>
<li>Three full days of outstanding Flex-related sessions</li>
<li>Ample networking time and opportunities with the brightest minds and biggest names in the Flex industry</li>
<li>Three (I think) parties with those same Flex industry folk and your fellow attendees</li>
<li>Catered lunch each day of the conference</li>
<li>A prime opportunity to enhance your career path through gained knowledge and contacts</li>
</ul>
<p>Just browse the <a href="http://www.360flex.com/speakers/">speaker list</a>, and you&#8217;ll see there is no hyperbole in my statements above. Check out the <a href="http://360flex.com/downloads/schedule.pdf">session schedule (PDF)</a> to see the topics being covered, and I bet you&#8217;ll be hard pressed to find a slot that doesn&#8217;t have at least one session that appeals to you.</p>
<p>360|Flex really is like the family reunion of the Flex industry. Come join the family. <a href="http://www.360flex.com/register/">REGISTER!</a></p>
<p>Oh yea, I will be giving a session on Swiz that introduces the framework and shows developers how to get up and running quickly, and how Swiz can help you be more productive writing code. I hope to see you there!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So in keeping up with <a href="../../../2008/03/feedback-from-my-session-at-360flex-atlanta/index.html">tradition</a> and the transparency philosophy of our gracious hosts, <a href="http://www.360conferences.com/surveyresponses/?attendeeID=3351535">here is the feedback</a> provided by people who attended <a href="http://link.brightcove.com/services/link/bcpid1753161885/bctid1738803361">my session</a> last month at eBay.</p>
<p>Overall I am pretty happy in that it seems like it was mostly well received. Just like last time I got both &#8220;too advanced&#8221; and &#8220;too basic&#8221; comments, which I suppose is to be expected from an intermediate session. I also got confused with <a href="http://blog.benstucki.net/">Ben Stucki</a> one more time, which happened to both of us more than once at the conference. Its all good though, Stucki is a genius.</p>
<p>I (again) apologize for finishing so early, when I gave the same presentation in Atlanta there were lots of questions during the session and we ended right on time. Not having that aspect really threw things off and in the future I will make sure to have extra content prepared just in case.</p>
<p>I really want my next presentation to be a lot more advanced and code-centric. I&#8217;d love to not even have slides, but I think that could be risky too, who knows. I haven&#8217;t thought of a topic yet, so if you have any ideas or requests send &#8216;em my way.</p>
<p>Thanks a bunch to everyone who attended and everyone who provided feedback!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yep, in just one short month the best Flex conference around will kick off its fifth installment in San Jose, California. Its almost silly how much I look forward to these things but they are just that good. Great people, great sessions and great parties (where a good lot of the best conversations happen) is just something you can&#8217;t pass up. Especially for under $500! Besides, you can talk your company into paying right? I guarantee you will come back a better developer.</p>
<p>I am honored to be speaking at this event again, especially when you look at the unbelievable speaker lineup as a whole. Check out just this small excerpt:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following <a href="http://adamflater.blogspot.com/2008/03/360flex-atlanta-survey-results.html">Adam&#8217;s lead</a>, again, I thought I would post the link to the feedback provided by people who attended <a href="../../../2008/02/my-slides-from-360flex-atlanta/index.html">my session</a> last week in Atlanta. <a href="http://www.360conferences.com/360flex/">Tom and John</a> rock the transparency vibe pretty hard so I figure its fitting for the speakers to do the same. This was my first time presenting at a conference and overall I was pretty happy with the outcome. I think the feedback stating it focused on FlexMDI a bit too much is probably valid and I apologize for that. My intention was simply to use it as a vehicle to illustrate the concepts I was discussing, I didn&#8217;t mean to showcase it in any way. I&#8217;d also like to repeat that I was/am not the only developer of FlexMDI. It was a joint effort between myself, <a href="http://brianjoseph31.typepad.com/smashedapples/">Brian Holmes</a> and <a href="http://www.meutzner.com/blog/">Brendan Meutzner</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.360conferences.com/surveyresponses/?attendeeID=1591388">View the feedback</a></p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who attended, even if you didn&#8217;t provide feedback! Though I <em>really</em> like those of you who did <img src='../../../wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have posted a PDF of the slides from my presentation earlier today. The topic was <a href="../../../files/talks/360Flex_Atlanta_Preso.pdf">Creating Flexible Components for Reuse and Distribution</a> and we covered some things to keep in mind when creating components that you want to use across different projects and/or release to the public. There was a really good turnout and the material seemed well received. These slides aren&#8217;t very detailed because I am a big believer in minimal amounts of text on slides but I think there is enough to make them worth posting. I settled for PDF because the rest of Keynote&#8217;s export options kind of suck and its late. I&#8217;m tired. If anyone wants to add them to something like <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">SlideShare</a> feel free to do so and send me the link.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In just under a month, the amazing <a href="http://lordbron.wordpress.com/">Tom</a> and <a href="http://www.johnwilker.com/">John</a> will, once again, orchestrate what is sure to be an amazing conference. If you have any desire at all to improve your Flex skills, meet fellow developers, find a Flex job, hire a Flex developer or just have a really good time with lots of smart, cool people <a href="http://www.360conferences.com/360flex/">you should definitely attend</a>. For $480 you can&#8217;t beat it with a stick.</p>
<p>As the title implies, I will be speaking at the conference. My session is titled &#8220;Creating Flexible Components for Reuse and Distribution&#8221; and will discuss just that. I will be covering considerations and practices that are useful when you want to create something that will be useful beyond your immediate need or project. Most of the main ideas will be accompanied by examples from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flexmdi/">flexmdi</a> since reuse and flexibility were main goals of the project, but the concepts will definitely be widely applicable. I would consider it an intermediate level session so you don&#8217;t need to be a guru to attend, but hopefully the content will be interesting to developers of all skill levels, including you rock stars out there. Last time I checked I was speaking opposite Ben Forta so if you&#8217;re a CFer I will understand if I don&#8217;t see you. Otherwise come join me! The session will be pretty free-form and casual; if people want to shout out questions (or insults, whatever) in the middle thats fine by me. In fact, I hope there will be audience participation in the form of questions, comments, alternative approaches, etc. Should be a good time.</p>
<p>So I hope to see you in the audience, but even more so I hope to see you at the conference. Tom and John put on amazing events, have amazing passion for our industry and deserve nothing less than a stellar turnout. If you&#8217;ve never been to a 360 event, you owe it to yourself to experience it firsthand. Its awful friggin&#8217; cool. So come out, learn something, meet someone or just enjoy the ATL. I promise you won&#8217;t regret it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The awesome guys from 360Conferences have <a href="http://www.360conferences.com/360flex/2007/12/360flex-want-full-day-of-flex-training.html">just announced</a> that the next installment of 360Flex will be an even better deal than it already was. They are offering a full day of Flex 101 training the day before the conference begins, meaning even if you have no Flex experience whatsoever, you can spend 4 days in Hotlanta and come out with some serious knowledge. Back in August I went to my first ever tech conference: 360Flex in Seattle. I was immediately hooked. The small size combined with great sessions makes for a really amazing conference and community experience, and for their prices you really can&#8217;t beat it. They charge approximately 50% of what most other conferences do.</p>
<p>So do yourself a favor and head to 360Flex in February. Whether you&#8217;re a Flex n00b, novice or ninja it will be worth your time and your career will probably thank you for it. I hear they even have some pretty sweet <a href="http://www.360conferences.com/360flex/2007/11/360flex-atlanta-speaker-list-is-on-fire.html">new speakers</a> this time around. <img src='../../../wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>See you in Atlanta!</p>
