						<p>Following <a href="http://adamflater.blogspot.com/2008/03/360flex-atlanta-survey-results.html">Adam&#8217;s lead</a>, again, I thought I would post the link to the feedback provided by people who attended <a href="../../../../2008/02/my-slides-from-360flex-atlanta/index.html">my session</a> last week in Atlanta. <a href="http://www.360conferences.com/360flex/">Tom and John</a> rock the transparency vibe pretty hard so I figure its fitting for the speakers to do the same. This was my first time presenting at a conference and overall I was pretty happy with the outcome. I think the feedback stating it focused on FlexMDI a bit too much is probably valid and I apologize for that. My intention was simply to use it as a vehicle to illustrate the concepts I was discussing, I didn&#8217;t mean to showcase it in any way. I&#8217;d also like to repeat that I was/am not the only developer of FlexMDI. It was a joint effort between myself, <a href="http://brianjoseph31.typepad.com/smashedapples/">Brian Holmes</a> and <a href="http://www.meutzner.com/blog/">Brendan Meutzner</a>.</p>

						<p>I have posted a PDF of the slides from my presentation earlier today. The topic was <a href="../../../../files/talks/360Flex_Atlanta_Preso.pdf">Creating Flexible Components for Reuse and Distribution</a> and we covered some things to keep in mind when creating components that you want to use across different projects and/or release to the public. There was a really good turnout and the material seemed well received. These slides aren&#8217;t very detailed because I am a big believer in minimal amounts of text on slides but I think there is enough to make them worth posting. I settled for PDF because the rest of Keynote&#8217;s export options kind of suck and its late. I&#8217;m tired. If anyone wants to add them to something like <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">SlideShare</a> feel free to do so and send me the link.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="postcontent">
						<p>I just uploaded a new ZIP file to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flexmdi/">flexmdi</a> site. This release contains both bug fixes and enhancements, though the additions may be somewhat transparent to a lot of users. I did a pretty bad job of tracking which issues I fixed and closed during this update, but I think there were at least 20 of them. There were a few issues around focus and z-order that were fixed, support for basic truncation of window titles was added, did some general refactoring and MDIManager has a new enforceBoundaries property that when set to false will allow windows to be dragged partially outside of their container. The default value is true and MDICanvas has the same property which just acts as a pass through for convenience.</p>
<h4>Window Controls</h4>
<p>The biggest changes, however, are around styling and the layout of window controls in the title bar. The <a href="../../../../flexmdi/docs/flexmdi/containers/MDIWindowControlsContainer.html">MDIWindowControlsContainer</a> class is now the default class responsible for laying out things like minimize, maximize and close buttons. You can create subclasses of this class and then assign them to windows via the <code>windowControls</code> property to give your windows a different appearance. To do basic modifications you simply override the updateDisplayList() method like in any other component and flexmdi handles the rest. You can also override createChildren() if you want a set of controls that differ from the defaults. MDIWindowControlsContainer extends LayoutContainer, so you can set the layout property to achieve either absolute, horizontal or vertical layouts. The default is a horizontal layout like HBox that positions itself on the right side of the titleBar. You can easily implement different layouts though and we've included a couple of them in the examples.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../flexmdi/explorer/index.html">Check out the updated explorer</a> and use the styles dropdown on the top right to see examples what kind of different layouts are now possible. The Windows XP style just uses a different horizontalGap than the default layout but the Mac OS 9 style is significantly different. To lend more power to the layout containers, I also exposed the titleTextField of the windows (via MDIWindow.getTitleTextField()) which is protected by default and the titleIconObject (via MDIWindow.getTitleIconObject()) which is mx_internal by default.</p>
<h4>Styling</h4>
<p>The other significant work was related to default styling of the windows and implementing a system to allow easy overriding of styles. <a href="../../../../flexmdi/docs/flexmdi/containers/MDIWindow.html">MDIWindow</a> now has a windowStyleName property that allows you to point it to a master style that will be applied to that window. That style then points to substyles to allow fine grained control over individual aspects of window styling. You can of course also override styles by setting values inline via MXML attributes. A master style might look something like this:</p>
<div class="syntax_hilite">
<div id="actionscript-1">
<div class="actionscript">.<span style="color: #006600;">customWindowStyle</span><br />
<span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; styleNameFocus: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"myWindowFocus"</span>;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; styleNameNoFocus: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"myWindowNoFocus"</span>;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; titleStyleName: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"myTitleStyle"</span>;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; minimizeBtnStyleName: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"myMinimizeBtn"</span>;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; maximizeBtnStyleName: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"myMaximizeBtn"</span>;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; restoreBtnStyleName: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"myRestoreBtn"</span>;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; closeBtnStyleName: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"myCloseBtn"</span>;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; windowControlsClass: ClassReference<span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"somePackage.MyCustomControlsContainer"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>;<br />
<span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>I am planning on doing a post specifically about the new styling options but there are a couple of things to note here. styleNameFocus and styleNameNoFocus are just what they sound like. The styles they point to will be applied to the window depending on whether or not it has focus. (Which reminds me, there is now a hasFocus property on MDIWindow.) The other significant piece of the style declaration is the windowControlsClass style which, as you can see points to a ClassReference. This class will be detected and applied when the windowStyleName property is set, if necessary, allowing full control over window styling at runtime.</p>
<h4>Default behaviors</h4>
<p>The process for preventing/delaying default behaviors has also changed slightly. We have implemented the behavior described by Darron Schall <a href="http://www.darronschall.com/weblog/archives/000276.cfm">here</a> as it really is more proper than our initial implementation. The gist is that you now use event.preventDefault() instead of event.stopImmediatePropagation() and instead of storing the event for later execution you store a copy of it by using event.clone(). Darron's post is worth reading though so if you have time I would recommend getting the full scoop.</p>
<p>I think those are all of the major changes in 1.1 but I plan on taking a closer look at some of the topics in dedicated posts in the future. I've got a crazy couple of weeks ahead of me but I will do my best to get them up soon. If you have requests or suggestions for particular topics you'd like to see covered let me know in the comments. You can also find the full documentation <a href="../../../../flexmdi/docs/index.html">here</a> and as always, let us know what you think!</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="postcontent">
						<p>Today marks the beginning of my final week as a <a href="http://www.fidelity.com/">Fidelity Investments</a> employee. I have accepted an offer to join <a href="http://www.universalmind.com/">Universal Mind</a>, where I will get to focus on using Adobe Flex to build great software for their impressive client list. I am super excited and extremely honored that I will get to work alongside <a href="http://www.darronschall.com/weblog/">Darron Schall</a>, <a href="http://www.dougmccune.com/">Doug McCune</a>, <a href="http://adamflater.blogspot.com/">Adam Flater</a> and a host of other wickedly smart people. I didn't even realize Darron worked for UM so imagine my surprise when I saw his name on the invite list for my Technical Interview. The dude has written a freakin' Commodore 64 emulator and a VNC client in AS3. I mean come on. He thankfully didn't ask me any questions about emulators though and I must have done alright since I officially start on February 19th. I can't wait to get started and begin contributing to the amazing team Universal Mind has assembled.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The rest of this post is a fairly detailed explanation on my reasoning behind this move. I began writing it simply for posterity and my own benefit but after reading <a href="http://blog.digitalbackcountry.com/?p=1258">Ryan</a> and <a href="http://www.chuckstar.com/blog/?p=142">Chuck</a>'s posts I suppose it can serve as another perspective/response to their discussions as well. If you could give a rat's bleep about my thought process (99.9999% of you by my estimation), you can stop reading now.</p>
<p>Leaving Fidelity was not an easy decision. In addition to the fact that I have made some very good friends and enjoyed the two years I spent there, its a very stable company with amazing benefits and they treat their employees extremely well. The company has also historically been very forward thinking when it comes to technology and continues to devote considerable attention and resources to IT, including a pretty significant adoption of Flex in several areas of the company. They were one of the first, if not the first, financial firms to use things like account management via automated telephone systems, the Web and data centers. Their web site(s) is/are still very good and are consistently rated the best in their industry. If you're like me and prefer to do just about everything online, (people still writes checks and mail them in envelopes?) I would highly recommend using Fidelity. The rare times you do have to call them you receive top notch customer service from knowledgeable reps. I can also say they are genuinely focused on making their customers successful and prosperous. So why am I leaving a company I obviously hold in such high regard? The department I work in has recently gone through a restructuring to more closely align with overall company goals, and as a result our Flex work has dried up. There is a lot of Flex work going on in other parts of the company, but that doesn't help me much. If I had stayed I would be doing primarily ASP.NET work for at least the next year, which is not something I am interested in doing full-time.</p>
<p>I decided to use that upheaval as a reason to look into the consulting world everyone has been raving about. As a husband and father I can only consider jobs that provide full benefits, and as a result have been watching the Flex consulting circus from afar for some time now with a mixture of jealousy and curiosity. Before the changes in my department, however, I couldn't justify leaving the position I was already in. I was working on cool projects that people actually use to do their jobs, was the go to guy for Flash and Flex in my department and I live less than 3 miles from work. I had also casually discussed jobs with a couple of consulting firms in the past, but for various reasons didn't feel like they were a good fit for me. Having heard good things about UM and seeing they had hired some real all-stars I decided to look into them a bit further. After sending my resume in I had an initial interview and then a second. The second was the Technical Interview I mentioned above and I have to say it was a blast. It was <a href="http://www.thomasburleson.biz/">Thomas Burleson</a>, Darron and Doug drilling me with questions for 90 minutes. Very cool, especially since I knew most of the answers. <img src='../../../../wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Throughout the entire process with UM, the people I dealt with were smart, passionate about their jobs and simply seemed like good people. What more can you really ask for?</p>
<p>I guess what it essentially comes down to is that I want to spend my working hours building killer Flex apps. When I finally started playing with Flex almost two years ago (Flex 2 Beta 2) it renewed a passion for learning and improving my skills that I hadn't experienced since first discovering Flash and programming in college. When you find something you enjoy this much, you want to do it as much as possible, alongside the best possible people, on the biggest possible stage. For me right now that is UM. My position at Fidelity is definitely what Chuck refers to as a "career job" in that I could work there for another 30 years and retire somewhat early and be very comfortable financially. In the end though I felt like I am young enough and its early enough in my career that I want to take on a new challenge. Out of college I worked in a very small design agency (I was employee #5 when I started) and then moved on to Fidelity where last I heard there are about 46,000 employees. I feel like consulting via UM will allow me to experience a lot of the shades of gray between those two extremes while retaining the relative security of full-time employee status. It also gives me an opportunity to work alongside people I can learn (a lot) from. Don't get me wrong, I worked with a lot of smart people at Fidelity who could teach me volumes on a variety of topics, but when I hit a brick wall with a Flex problem there weren't a lot of internal resources to turn to. Not so at Universal Mind. Their existing team reads like a virtual who's who of the Flex community. Now my problem won't be getting an answer, it will be trying to not look like an idiot in the process. <img src='../../../../wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>So to everyone at Fidelity, best of luck and thank you for the past two years. I thoroughly enjoyed and genuinely appreciate everything I experienced there. Hopefully our paths will cross again at some point down the road.</p>
<p>To everyone at UM I can't wait to get settled, meet those of you I haven't, and start building first class Flex applications with you. The industry is on fire, lets get our gas cans.</p>

						<p>The following is an unedited email thread I have had with a reader over the past week or so. I <a href="../../../../2007/09/flexmdi-starting-out-simple-with-mdicanvas/index.html#comment-16089">helped him</a> learn how to add a SWC to a Flex project but apparently that (and FlexMDI) wasn't good enough. The quotes next to the green bars are mine.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I have decided to remove Keith's identifying information from this post. While I haven't received any kind of apology from him, as one commenter pointed out some employers could deem his behavior enough to warrant termination from a job or perhaps prevent the acquisition of a future job. Nothing of that magnitude was what I intended by publishing this. I was simply trying to point out two things. One, don't be ungrateful, especially when getting something at no cost. Two, just because you're communicating "on the internet" doesn't mean its OK to be a jerk, and your actions may very well become public knowledge. I think this post still accomplishes its goals without his info. So you're welcome Keith, again.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey Ben,</p>
<p>Thanks again for all the help in getting the demos to work.  As I mentioned in my last post the only problem I am having now is trying to get the maximize and minimize events to work. When I add one of them to a <flexmdi:MDIWindow> I get "Event type 'mdi.events:MDIWindowEvent' is unavailable"</p>
<p>Any ideas??</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Keith</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="ben"><p>Not sure what you mean exactly, can you show some code?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>sure<br />
... code snippet ...</p>
<p>When I compile that I get "Event type 'mdi.events:MDIWindowEvent' is<br />
unavailable" on the MDIWindow code.  If I remove<br />
the "maximize" event parameter it compiles and runs fine.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="ben"><p>Sorry, I dunno. Maybe try importing MDIWindowEvent?</p>
<p>Ben</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Sadly it already is. I just took the sample code and added the maximize parameter.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="ben"><p>So its just the explorer with one attribute added?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Any idea ?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="ben"><p>Sorry, I don't really have time to investigate right now. I would suggest posting your issue on flexcoders.</p>
<p>Ben</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Lol. Ok. I didn't realize they would comment on 3rd party code. I apologize -- I thought you were one of the developers of this component.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="ben"><p>No problem, I am, I just have a lot going on right now. Sorry.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>You knoiw what never mind. Pisses me off to no end when a developer won't take the time to troubleshoot his own code.  I'd fire you if you worked for me.  Guess now that its published and the articles have been written and your presentations made you don't give a flip.<br />
There is a another component someone else wrote. I'll just check it out instead.<br />
Maybe I will post to flexcoders and explain that the person who helped write it wouldn't take the time to help out. Yeah that should look good.<br />
Thanks for ummm..  Well nothing I guess. Enjoy</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="ben"><p>Wow, you're amazing you know it? I have a family, a full-time job and other shit going on, I've spent countless hours writing the code, written articles, answered several questions on my blog (including yours) and on flexcoders, and because I don't have time to investigate your question right now that makes me a bad person/developer? You've been given a very good library for zero cost and you throw a temper tantrum because I can't personally investigate your issue? Why can't you post to flexcoders? Shit man, put forth some effort! The code has been downloaded over 6000 times and nobody has ever reported this issue. Doesn't mean its not a valid problem, but asking you to do a little bit more than flood my inbox whining that it doesn't work is a reasonable request. Please do post your complaint to flexcoders. Please.</p>
<p>Jeez man, you couldn't be more unappreciative. What exactly makes you feel entitled to free code plus support? Tell you what, send me $100 and I will be glad to investigate your issue personally. After all, I am sure you're getting paid for the project you're using our code in, so lets be fair and share the wealth. Right?</p>

						<p>In just under a month, the amazing <a href="http://lordbron.wordpress.com/">Tom</a> and <a href="http://www.johnwilker.com/">John</a> will, once again, orchestrate what is sure to be an amazing conference. If you have any desire at all to improve your Flex skills, meet fellow developers, find a Flex job, hire a Flex developer or just have a really good time with lots of smart, cool people <a href="http://www.360conferences.com/360flex/">you should definitely attend</a>. For $480 you can't beat it with a stick.</p>
<p>As the title implies, I will be speaking at the conference. My session is titled "Creating Flexible Components for Reuse and Distribution" and will discuss just that. I will be covering considerations and practices that are useful when you want to create something that will be useful beyond your immediate need or project. Most of the main ideas will be accompanied by examples from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flexmdi/">flexmdi</a> since reuse and flexibility were main goals of the project, but the concepts will definitely be widely applicable. I would consider it an intermediate level session so you don't need to be a guru to attend, but hopefully the content will be interesting to developers of all skill levels, including you rock stars out there. Last time I checked I was speaking opposite Ben Forta so if you're a CFer I will understand if I don't see you. Otherwise come join me! The session will be pretty free-form and casual; if people want to shout out questions (or insults, whatever) in the middle thats fine by me. In fact, I hope there will be audience participation in the form of questions, comments, alternative approaches, etc. Should be a good time.</p>
<p>So I hope to see you in the audience, but even more so I hope to see you at the conference. Tom and John put on amazing events, have amazing passion for our industry and deserve nothing less than a stellar turnout. If you've never been to a 360 event, you owe it to yourself to experience it firsthand. Its awful friggin' cool. So come out, learn something, meet someone or just enjoy the ATL. I promise you won't regret it.</p>

                    <div class="postcontent">
						<p>Every now and then I stumble across something in the Flex framework that I am both surprised and sorry I didn't know about sooner. Like the fact that <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/labs/flex3/langref/mx/controls/CheckBox.html">CheckBox</a> has a built-in <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/labs/flex3/langref/mx/controls/Button.html#clickHandler()">clickHandler</a> method. Duh. LayoutContainer just may be one of the most useful classes around, especially if you're creating components you want to be reusable and flexible. First, a little background.</p>
<p>Its fairly common knowledge that <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/labs/flex3/langref/mx/containers/VBox.html">VBox</a> and <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/labs/flex3/langref/mx/containers/HBox.html">HBox</a> both extend <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/labs/flex3/langref/mx/containers/Box.html">Box</a> and do nothing more than set a <code>direction</code> property. What may be a bit less obvious is the fact that the direction property is actually applied to an internal <code>layoutObject</code> property. In the case of Box (and by extension VBox and HBox), layoutObject is of type <code>BoxLayout</code>. As it turns out, <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/labs/flex3/langref/mx/containers/Canvas.html">Canvas</a> uses an internal layoutObject as well, but in that case its an instance of <code>CanvasLayout</code>. Now notice that my references to both BoxLayout and CanvasLayout are not linked to the corresponding documentation. This is because Adobe has specifically excluded them from the documentation because, for whatever reason, Joe Developer isn't supposed to directly use them.</p>
<p>When I first discovered this I set about using them anyways because I had been struggling to find an optimal solution to a problem for a couple of days. Sure they always say things "may not be supported in future versions" but when was the last time they actually pulled something out and besides, where's your sense of adventure? I was on my way to creating a base class that could act like a Canvas, VBox or HBox using some intelligent switching between what type of layoutObject (and direction) it used. I was happy. Well, I didn't get far before I started hitting errors due to not implementing some deeply nested interface or some other nonsense. I was no longer happy. Thankfully, while digging through source and documentation I stumbled onto <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/labs/flex3/langref/mx/core/LayoutContainer.html">LayoutContainer</a>. Lo and behold it does exactly what I was trying to accomplish! By changing the <code>layout</code> property between "absolute", "vertical" and "horizontal" (defined as constants on <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/labs/flex3/langref/mx/core/ContainerLayout.html">ContainerLayout</a>), you can have your container lay its children out like a Canvas would (direction = ContainerLayout.ABSOLUTE) or like a Box would (direction = ContainerLayout.VERTICAL | ContainerLayout.HORIZONTAL). I suppose this is only exciting if you have a need for this kind of functionality, which, who knows how common that is but it was an absolute life saver on my recent task.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for where this technique is getting applied but I will leave you with the chunk of code from LayoutContainer that does the magic referenced in this post.</p>

						<p>The awesome guys from 360Conferences have <a href="http://www.360conferences.com/360flex/2007/12/360flex-want-full-day-of-flex-training.html">just announced</a> that the next installment of 360Flex will be an even better deal than it already was. They are offering a full day of Flex 101 training the day before the conference begins, meaning even if you have no Flex experience whatsoever, you can spend 4 days in Hotlanta and come out with some serious knowledge. Back in August I went to my first ever tech conference: 360Flex in Seattle. I was immediately hooked. The small size combined with great sessions makes for a really amazing conference and community experience, and for their prices you really can't beat it. They charge approximately 50% of what most other conferences do.</p>
<p>So do yourself a favor and head to 360Flex in February. Whether you're a Flex n00b, novice or ninja it will be worth your time and your career will probably thank you for it. I hear they even have some pretty sweet <a href="http://www.360conferences.com/360flex/2007/11/360flex-atlanta-speaker-list-is-on-fire.html">new speakers</a> this time around. <img src='../../../../wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

						<p>As it turns out, truly reusable <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/201/langref/mx/controls/CheckBox.html">CheckBox</a> renderers are much simpler to create than I <a href="../../../../2006/11/creating-truly-reusable-renderers-with-classfactory/index.html">previously</a> <a href="../../../../2006/10/item-renderers-in-datagrids-a-primer-for-predictable-behavior/index.html">reported</a>. This post will provide and discuss what I think are the last CheckBox renderers you will ever need.</p>
<p>Did you know that CheckBox has a built-in click handler? I didn't until recently, despite its not-so-sneaky name of <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/201/langref/mx/controls/Button.html#clickHandler()">clickHandler</a>. It is a protected function, so its only accessible if you subclass CheckBox, but that's OK since our renderers will do just that. clickHandler is key to creating these reusable renderers and keeping them super simple.</p>
<p>Before I start in on my inevitably wordy and detailed description lets take a look at our end result. <a href="../../../../files/CheckBoxRenderers/index.html" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/files/CheckBoxRenderers/');">CheckBoxRenderers in action</a> and the <a href="../../../../files/CheckBoxRenderers/srcview/index.html" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/files/CheckBoxRenderers/source/');">source</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I initially forgot to mention that these renderers are heavily based on and influenced by the information provided by Flex Jedi <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/aharui/">Alex Harui</a> on his blog. Thanks to Alex for illustrating "the right way" to do things.</p>
<p>This time around we will start with the item renderer since it is the simpler of the two. (Both of these classes center the CheckBox as that is the most common request, but if you don't need them centered simply remove the updateDisplayList() functions.)</p>

<p>There are 2 major differences between this class and our previous version. First, it doesn't implement <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/201/langref/mx/core/ClassFactory.html">ClassFactory</a>, which means we can simply type its fully qualified class name into the itemRenderer attribute of a DataGrid and it will work (just like with mx.controls.CheckBox), requiring one less bindable variable in our file. The reason we can do this is that CheckBox, and by extension CenteredCheckBoxItemRenderer implement <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/201/langref/mx/controls/listClasses/IDropInListItemRenderer.html">IDropInListItemRenderer</a>. I won't go into the full details (if anyone would like me to dedicate a post to describing this more fully let me know) but in the case of CheckBox, that basically means that it knows how to set its selected state based on a piece of data that is passed to it. The second major difference is closely related to this fact, which is that we no longer have to override the data setter- we get that functionality for free.</p>
<p>The most important line in the item renderer class is essentially the other half of the equation. Whereas we get data retrieval and rendering for free, we have to provide the data setting functionality. That is really the only thing that separates it from a regular CheckBox other than the centering code, and its accomplished with this single line of code:</p>
<p><code>data[DataGridListData(listData).dataField] = selected;</code></p>
<p>This line uses the listData property (defined by IDropInListItemRenderer) to locate and update the specific piece of data this CheckBox is rendering in our DataGrid.</p>
<p>The CenteredCheckBoxHeaderRender class is pretty similar to my previous version in that it still implements IFactory and has to be implemented as a ClassFactory instance. For details on using ClassFactory see the previous post referenced above. The main differences this time around are that the class is defined in ActionScript rather than MXML and streamlines things by using the built-in clickHandler function. Below is the portion of the class we will discuss further.</p>

<p>As discussed in the previous post, headerRenderers get initialized repeatedly during their existence. This means that we are unable to store any kind of state for them inside themselves because it will get reset over and over again. To work around this we define the stateHost and stateProperty variables which will be assigned via the properties property of ClassFactory. (Again, see previous post for a more thorough explanation of ClassFactory.) In our example application we point these to a selectAllFlag variable (the stateProperty) defined in the main application (the stateHost property). The overridden data setter shown above then uses this external value to set the selected state of our component. Correspondingly, clickHandler sets this value when our CheckBox is clicked, saving our state out to a safe, external location.</p>
<p>Two minor things to mention about our application are a couple of attributes set on the DataGridColumn that our renderers live in. First, notice that we set a dataField attribute like usual. This is required for our new itemRenderer class to work properly, whereas it was not needed when using ClassFactory for both the headerRenderer and itemRenderer. The second important point is that we have set the column's sortable attribute to false. This is necessary in order to ensure clicks in the header are processed as CheckBox clicks and not sorting actions. Also note that we process the header click and set the item values in the main file. While it would be possible to do this inside the header renderer class leaving it outside makes the renderer that much more flexible.</p>
<p>Hopefully this all makes sense, is not too long winded and provides renderers that others can and will use in future projects. Please post questions, complaints and comments in the... well... comments.</p>
