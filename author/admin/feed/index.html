			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a post here for posterity in case myself or someone else needs to fix this in the future. In many cases when I use drawCircle() in the Flash Player, it creates a somewhat distorted shape. One or more sides of the circle appear smashed or clipped. To fix this, you add the following code just before the drawCircle() call.</p>
<p><code>graphics.lineStyle( 1, 0, 0, true );</code></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>360|Flex DC was last week, and it was a great time. I got to see a lot of old friends and met a ton of new, cool people. I&#8217;m not sure how useful they will be on their own, but I wanted to post my slides here for anyone who might be interested in them. I had planned to do a walk through of a Swiz application that includes Flex modules, but was pretty low on time and had to run through it pretty quickly. I will be cleaning up that example soon and pushing it to GitHub as our reference implementation of using Swiz with Flex Modules, but it&#8217;s not quite ready yet.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The vaunted, venerable and value-laden 360|Flex conference is coming to Washington D.C. in a few weeks, and you really should be there. This will be my fifth 360 event in total, and my third time speaking, and I can honestly say I&#8217;ve never had less than an awesome time at the event. Regardless of your skill set/level, position on your career path or otherwise, if you are part of the Flex community or wish you were, 360|Flex is the place be. For the incredibly reasonable price of <a href="http://www.360flex.com/register/">$599</a>, you get no less than the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>One full day of hands on Flex-related training</li>
<li>Three full days of outstanding Flex-related sessions</li>
<li>Ample networking time and opportunities with the brightest minds and biggest names in the Flex industry</li>
<li>Three (I think) parties with those same Flex industry folk and your fellow attendees</li>
<li>Catered lunch each day of the conference</li>
<li>A prime opportunity to enhance your career path through gained knowledge and contacts</li>
</ul>
<p>Just browse the <a href="http://www.360flex.com/speakers/">speaker list</a>, and you&#8217;ll see there is no hyperbole in my statements above. Check out the <a href="http://360flex.com/downloads/schedule.pdf">session schedule (PDF)</a> to see the topics being covered, and I bet you&#8217;ll be hard pressed to find a slot that doesn&#8217;t have at least one session that appeals to you.</p>
<p>360|Flex really is like the family reunion of the Flex industry. Come join the family. <a href="http://www.360flex.com/register/">REGISTER!</a></p>
<p>Oh yea, I will be giving a session on Swiz that introduces the framework and shows developers how to get up and running quickly, and how Swiz can help you be more productive writing code. I hope to see you there!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update: </strong> Swiz now supports custom namespaces automatically, so this post is fairly irrelevant. For more info see the <a href="http://swizframework.jira.com/wiki/display/SWIZ/Release+Notes">Swiz RC1 release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Every now and then someone expresses frustration with the fact that Swiz, and every other Flash Platform dependency injection solution I know of, can only inject into public members. I started thinking about it yesterday and figured it actually wouldn&#8217;t be that hard to use a custom namespace rather than public. Granted, it&#8217;s not as nice as being able to use private members, but the Flash Player/AVM simply does not allow for that at this time. So tonight I spent about 15 minutes throwing together a proof of concept using Swiz 1.0&#8242;s new custom processor feature. What you see here is the result of that 15 minutes.</p>
<p>The first step was to create a custom namespace.<br />
<script src="http://gist.github.com/335930.js?file=gistfile1.as"></script></p>
<p>Then I created a view that defined some properties in that namespace.<br />
<script src="http://gist.github.com/335932.js?file=gistfile1.as"></script></p>
<p>I then created the custom processor to handle those special <code>[NSInject]</code> tags you see in the view. Subclassing Swiz&#8217;s built in InjectProcessor (which handles the standard [Inject] tags) allowed me to override just one simple method to accomplish my goal.<br />
<script src="http://gist.github.com/335934.js?file=gistfile1.as"></script></p>
<p>That&#8217;s it. It supports both property injection and setter injection, and has a ton of room for improvement. You could easily expand this to support the definition of specific namespaces in the metadata tag, or to read the namespace from the property, or some other enhancement I haven&#8217;t thought about. Remember, this was 15 minutes of coding; it has taken me longer to write this post than it did to create the processor and example app.</p>
<p>The ability to extend Swiz with custom processors is revealing itself to be an incredibly powerful feature. I fully believe it will turn out to be far more powerful than we even anticipated when we created it. We&#8217;ve not even released the 1.0 final version and people have already created processors related to <a href="http://www.riaspace.net/2009/12/logprocessor-custom-metadata-processor-for-swiz-1-0-0/">logging</a>, loading <a href="http://soenkerohde.com/2010/03/swiz-yahoo-finance-metadata-processor/">Yahoo Finance data</a>, and <a href="http://blog.foomonger.com/2010/02/26/swiz-signals-and-mediatesignal/">mediating AS3 Signals</a>.</p>
<p>What can you build?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently noticed a thoughtful bit of User Experience while using my windshield wipers. Like most modern cars, mine has an intermittent wiper mode that includes a dial to control the frequency of wiper activation. What I noticed is that when you adjust the frequency so that the wipers activate more often (in shorter intervals), they also activate immediately regardless of where it was in the timing cycle. When decreasing the activation frequency this does not happen, and the wipers don&#8217;t activate again until the next interval is reached.</p>
<p>Now, you may be thinking who the hell cares, but I haven&#8217;t been able to get it out of my head since I noticed it. I think it shows quite a bit of thoughtfulness by whoever came up with the idea and managed to get it implemented. It&#8217;s not something anyone would complain about if it weren&#8217;t there, and it surely goes unnoticed by hundreds of thousands of people, but it shows a clear understanding of users&#8217; intentions and acts on them. If you&#8217;re increasing the wiper activation frequency, it&#8217;s because the rain has picked up and you not only want the windshield cleared more quickly in the future, but you probably want it cleared now as well. After all, if the rain hadn&#8217;t built up on the windshield you&#8217;d have no reason to make the wipers go faster. Somebody recognized that and made sure that that desire, no matter how subtle, would be met.</p>
<p>The takeaway from this odd little post is hopefully that next time you are implementing a feature, think about not just what the user is doing, but why they&#8217;re doing it. If you do, you may be able to not only meet their expectations, but exceed them.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://github.com/robertpenner/as3-signals">AS3-Signals</a> is a recent project by <a href="http://robertpenner.com/flashblog/">Robert Penner</a> as an alternative to Flash Player&#8217;s native event system. While I don&#8217;t personally have (m)any problems with events, I have been curious about Signals and keeping an eye out for an opportunity to try it, especially in conjunction with <a href="http://swizframework.org/">Swiz</a>. That opportunity presented itself a few weeks ago, when <a href="http://joelhooks.com/">Joel Hooks</a> finally showed <del>me</del> the world that Robotlegs <a href="http://joelhooks.com/2010/01/16/robotlegs-image-gallery-example-using-as3-signals-and-the-presentation-model/">can be used</a> without extending framework classes all over the place. As he says in the post, I had been asking to see that for a long time, because I cringe at frameworks that mandate lock-in via inheritance.</p>
<p>In looking at Joel&#8217;s sample application (which I think is very good), I noticed that it was very similar to a Swiz application. The application is configured using a context class, which is virtually equivalent to a Swiz instance used to configure an area of a Swiz application (or a whole application). So I spent about 15 minutes and took the latest Swiz SWC I had, created a Swiz instance that mapped to his context, put it in the context&#8217;s place, and voila; I had the same application running on top of Swiz. Literally the only other thing I had to do was to add a single [PostConstruct] metadata tag. You can see the striking similarities below. <strong>Edit:</strong> I have now also included the same Swiz configuration as it would look in ActionScript.</p>
<p><strong>Swiz config in MXML</strong><br />
<script src="http://gist.github.com/301114.js?file=ImageGallerySwiz.mxml"></script><br />
<strong>RobotLegs config</strong><br />
<script src="http://gist.github.com/301114.js?file=ImageGalleryContext.as"></script><br />
<strong>Swiz config in ActionScript</strong><br />
<script src="http://gist.github.com/305648.js?file=ImageGallerySwizAS.as"></script></p>
<p>You can even take the resulting application and switch the framework it&#8217;s running in by simply commenting/uncommenting the ImageGallerySwiz and ImageGalleryContext lines in index.mxml</p>
<p><a href="../../../swiz/examples/SwizSignals/index.html">Application</a> :: <a href="../../../swiz/examples/SwizSignals/srcview/index.html">Source</a></p>
<p>Working with Signals couldn&#8217;t be simpler, and Swiz supports them right out of the box. In fact, I couldn&#8217;t help but be amused by the fact Swiz had better native support for them than RobotLegs did. <img src='../../../wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  They are simply defined in a BeanProvider like any other dependency, and then work as expected. The [PostConstruct] I added was on LoadGalleryCommand&#8217;s execute() method, and it replaces the last line of ImageGalleryContext&#8217;s startup() method.</p>
<h5>Summary</h5>
<p>I really like the fact that applications can be somewhat interchangeable between the two frameworks now that we&#8217;ve settled on <code>[Inject]</code>. I think a reasonable degree of portability is a sign of a good framework, and based on this example you can see that both RobotLegs and Swiz meet that criteria. The obvious question then, is why pick one over the other? Some of it surely comes down to personal preference, but beyond that I think it is a question of power, scalability, adaptability and developer productivity. In future posts, I will show how Swiz is the clear winner in those categories. <img src='../../../wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night while working on <a href="http://swizframework.org/">Swiz</a> I ran into <a href="http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FB-12316">FB-12316 &#8211; Code hinting doesn&#8217;t work with DefaultProperty</a>. It has been fixed in Flash Builder, but those of us still using Flex Builder were apparently out of luck. What the problem boils down to is that if you are using the <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=metadata_3.html#197532">[DefaultProperty] metadata tag</a> to point to an Array property, code completion breaks unless the property is decorated with <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/metadata_3.html#162732">[ArrayElementType] metadata</a>.</p>
<p>My Array was not decorated because it can hold items of any type. Therefore, code completion was borked. I wrestled with the problem for a long time, and then as I was waiting to fall asleep last night it occurred to me that in ActionScript everything is actually a descendant of Object. So this morning the first thing I tried was decorating the property with <strong>[ArrayElementType( "Object" )]</strong> and it worked!</p>
<p>So there you have it, an easy workaround for Flex Builder users! I hope this helps someone get past this a lot quicker than I did.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
