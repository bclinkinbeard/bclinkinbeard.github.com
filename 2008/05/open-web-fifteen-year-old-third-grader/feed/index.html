		<description>True.  Now if we can just get Flash player to be search engine friendly, we wouldn&#039;t even need HTML.</description>

		<description>Oops, looks like some characters were stripped in the first message. Meant to say:

Great, so by the time I can use the Flash player to do real-time raytracing, I&#039;ll be able to replace &quot;div id=&#039;header&#039;&quot; with &quot;header&quot; in my HTML content.</description>

		<description>&quot;Work on HTML 5 is rapidly progressing, yet it is still expected to continue for several years. Due to the requirement to produce test cases and achieve interoperable implementations, current estimates have work finishing in around ten to fifteen years.&quot;

10 to 15 years?  Great, so by the time I can use the Flash player to do real-time raytracing, I&#039;ll be able to replace  with  in my HTML content.  Oh, whoops, that&#039;s not true, because it will probably take around 5 more years for HTML5 capable browsers to reach market saturation!  Guess I&#039;m stick with  tags for a few more decades. :-)

If it&#039;s going to take 10 to 15 years for the next HTML spec to come out, I think we can safely assume that the W3C has surrendered the future of the web to the private sector.  Good riddance :-)</description>
