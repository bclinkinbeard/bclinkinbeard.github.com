		<description>Fair enough Glenn but if a site is aimed at a small community what is it doing in an aggregator?</description>

		<description>can&#039;t agree I&#039;m afraid.

that&#039;s the point of using an aggregator, and the reason i tend not to.

many peoples blogs are aimed at small communities with very specific subjects and it&#039;s only at times of major announcements that this problem occurs.

I think it&#039;s a slight over reaction to think that 35 posts talking about such an import release is excessive.

i suppose there were just a lot of excited people out there.

		<description>Hi John,

Most of the sites didn&#039;t seem to be simple hit-seeking opportunists, but actual bloggers who generally focus on the Adobe ecosystem. For people in that category I think they just need to exercise some self restraint and good judgment. We all like traffic to our sites but I feel like you have to draw the line somewhere.

For the cases that are merely traffic whores, I think maybe a more thorough approval process for getting on the aggregation list could help. I don&#039;t know specifically how sites are evaluated today, and I am sure that is a low priority task within Adobe but I think it could help.

		<description>Agreed. But do you see a way we can improve things?

The downside of an aggregator is that it becomes an attraction for those who seek more attention. If there aren&#039;t feedback mechanisms to penalize words which weren&#039;t worth the reading, then self-promoters will gradually drive out those who are in it for the news value. We&#039;ve seen it happen with Digg, Techmeme, many sites.

But social feedback mechanisms are tricky. On political blogs, for instance, there will be incentive to mod-down competitors, or inconvenient questioners. And those modded-down will naturally want to push back.

I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a solution, but I don&#039;t see it clearly yet. Ideas...?
