		<description>[...] So a bunch of people have been posting the results of the surveys from their 360&#124;Flex sessions. I&#8217;ve wavered on this a tiny bit, I&#8217;m just a little embarrassed, both because of the positive feedback (*blushes*), but also because I offended some people in the session. So off the bat I want to say to anyone who was actually offended by anything said in my session: I&#8217;m sorry. I gave the session the way I talk in normal life, and in normal life I guess I have a dirty mouth. [...]</description>

		<description>Hey fellas! Thanks for the compliments, its always nice to hear people got something out of it.

@Frankie, good seeing you again man. I figured you would be there since it was ATL but it was kinda dumb luck that I found you at the keynote. Hope to see you at the next one and have some beers with ya. Enjoy fatherhood, you&#039;re in for quite a ride :)

@Ryan, good meeting you too. I&#039;d definitely be interested in seeing what you&#039;re doing if you&#039;re able to release it. Comparing approaches is always a good thing. I&#039;m pretty swamped these days but if you want to shoot me an email (top of sidebar on right) I will do my best to get back to you asap.

Talk to you guys soon.</description>

		<description>Hey Ben,

It was great meeting you at 360Flex and thought you gave an excellent presentation.  As someone who has been doing Flex since 1.0, it was great for me that you used a real project that you are working on rather than a simple, canned example.  Many of the people who responded that they didn&#039;t like the complexity of your example or that they thought you focused too much on FlexMDI were probably rather new to Flex and were trying to learn some basic fundamentals.  Perhaps your session title could have reflected your topic more clearly, but if it had, I simply would have been more apt to attend.

After attending the last 3 MAX conferences, FlexManiacs and 360Flex, I really appreciated being able to see a more in-depth view into what someone as talented as yourself has been working on and in particular, some of the challenges you faced during development.  I recently have been working on a lot of Windowing functionality for the Flex-based application platform we are building, and I am lobbying my management to allow me to share some of that work with the community.  At the very least, I&#039;d love to talk to you about some of the details sometime.

Cheers,
Ryan</description>

		<description>Ben, we really enjoyed your presentation here in Atlanta, GA Flex 360. It was informative and we where able to see some things that could help our team. We are doing some similar things here and it was nice to see your approach to windowing like you did in a neatly wrapped framework. I thought you spoke well and my only complaint was I wish that you could have maybe spoken for a little longer on the topic, but you did really good. I mean hey there is only so much time for this stuff I guess hehe. I do look forward to more posts and presentations in the future Ben. Again good to see ya!</description>
