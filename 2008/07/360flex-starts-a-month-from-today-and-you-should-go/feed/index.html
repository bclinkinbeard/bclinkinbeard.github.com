		<description>Seriously, if you can look at that list and still not want to go...you should really re-think your profession.

I can&#039;t wait to get out there, I&#039;ve only been to the local events here in Boston and definitely not for 3 days.

Finally going to get to put a face to all these names in the UM network. :)</description>
