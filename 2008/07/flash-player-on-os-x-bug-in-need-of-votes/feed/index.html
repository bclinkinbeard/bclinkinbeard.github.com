		<description>hello
I &#039;m using Adobe flash Player on Microsoft OS. I was really curios to know how the KeyboardEvent works on mac, I have tested it on my friend&#039;s computer.you  are right!. They should do something about it.
It&#039;s big Bug : 2 keys with the same key and could lead to many problems in complicated applications.</description>

		<description>That is quite some bug you found. Again and again I am amazed. I mean, Flash has been available on Mac for ages, so it puzzles me how this can suddenly become a problem. Are the developers sleeping or are they not getting enough salary?</description>
