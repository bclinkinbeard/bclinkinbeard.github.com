		<description>[...] I&#8217;m a little late in doing this, but what the hey! Well its over and back to work, eh? Time to put all that great knowledge to use and create some UX baby! 360&#124;Flex Atlanta was awesome. Kudos go to John Wilker and Tom Ortega for pulling off such a sweet event. Some awesome speakers were present and it was truly a developers conference. Some highlights of sessions I attended were Jun Heider&#8217;s talk on Memory Management, Ben Clickinbeard&#8217;s talk on Reusable components, and Ben Stucki&#8217;s far out You got to wear funny looking 3D glasses talk. Oh, and who could miss the bedazzling man o&#8217; the hour Doug McCune talking on Open Source Flex stuffs as well as some language antics. [...]</description>

		<description>[...] Following Adam&#8217;s lead, again, I thought I would post the link to the feedback provided by people who attended my session last week in Atlanta. Tom and John rock the transparency vibe pretty hard so I figure its fitting for the speakers to do the same. This was my first time presenting at a conference and overall I was pretty happy with the outcome. I think the feedback stating it focused on FlexMDI a bit too much is probably valid and I apologize for that. My intention was simply to use it as a vehicle to illustrate the concepts I was discussing, I didn&#8217;t mean to showcase it in any way. I&#8217;d also like to repeat that I was/am not the only developer of FlexMDI. It was a joint effort between myself, Brian Holmes and Brendan Meutzner. [...]</description>
