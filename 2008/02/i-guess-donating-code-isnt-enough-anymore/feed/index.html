		<description>People are nuts. They don&#039;t appreciate someone&#039;s time. 
We&#039;ve opensourced our Clear Toolkit library, wrote and published decent documentation, but recently I had a similar correspondence with one frustrated user, who didn&#039;t take time to read the manual. When I answered RTFM, he responded angrily, &quot;I thought I&#039;ve read somewhere that your product comes with a month of free tech support&quot;.
I can tell you more, such idiots can spoil your reputation by badmouthing you online.
I hate giving software away for free, because people are fucking nuts!</description>

		<description>Man, I wonder what this guy does when someone gets his order wrong at the drive thru of McDonald&#039;s.  He probably goes ballistic and tells them the same thing, &quot;You&#039;d all be fired if you worked for me!&quot;

The same type of guy probably threatened to sue Google when they didn&#039;t index his website.</description>

		<description>wow...i didn&#039;t realize how much entertainment i was missing. i&#039;m a little behind the curve on this one, but let me just chime in now...

what a total shitbox this guy is. i love how the interweb allows one to all of a sudden become Mouth McToughKins when in real life, keith is probably a highly fragile piece of mommy&#039;s good china.

you write good stuff, ben. it&#039;s cool to see how much you&#039;ve grown over the years...

		<description>All I can say is, thank you for providing great resources and explanations to the community.  I came across your site a little while back when researching checkbox item renderer&#039;s.  It&#039;s people like you that keep the scene alive and interesting to be a part of.  Keep up the good work and don&#039;t let the unappreciative get to you.  They will self destruct on there own.</description>

		<description>Dear Keith,

Crack a book, and learn how to fix the problem yourself.  Honestly, this was a free component that you got, and you&#039;re lucky to even have talented people like Ben posting this for the community.  I thank God every day for people like Ben and other super talented developers that post open-source components...They make me, and my projects, look and function way better than I ever could.

A few questions are okay, but you don&#039;t have to be a bastard about it.  Here are some words of wisdom:  &quot;You&#039;ll attract more flies with honey than with vinegar.&quot;</description>

		<description>So good!
Its sad that understanding the concept of &#039;Being a dick will not get you help&#039; goes so far over some folk&#039;s heads. ;)

Oh well, folks that are smart enough to understand are usually smart enough to use google as well. :)</description>

		<description>Crazy... Just want to add that I had a issue (of my own creation) with my implementation of this great framework - I posted a comment on this site and received a reply from Ben very quickly, which then moved to email. I was surprised to get a response within the same day as my post - thanks again Ben.

This is free code! I was looking at a requirement for this functionality for an upcoming project and would have spent a lot of time (cash) to achieve the same results.

Keith - surely you could have spent a couple of hours making a build of the flexMDI library yourself and had a crack at debugging it before freaking out...</description>
