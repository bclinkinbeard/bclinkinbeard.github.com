		<description>I had a closer look into this and found that all I needed to do was add a ControlBar to the MDIWindow (Has to be the last item I add). Perhaps I will update your code when I become more fluent with Flex but, for the time being, everything works the way I want it to.

Thanks for a great library.</description>

		<description>Thanks for the link Raul, looks cool. I don&#039;t speak Spanish but tinkering was fun. :)

Steve, not a bad idea. I could have sworn Panel showed its status text at the bottom like that but it doesn&#039;t appear that it does. Adding that functionality wouldn&#039;t be super easy but it could certainly be done. Feel free to add an enhancement request at http://code.google.com/p/flexmdi/ or better yet code it up and send it to us! :) To be completely honest I probably won&#039;t have much time to devote to flexmdi for the next few months but maybe Brian or Brendan will feel inspired and give it a shot. Thanks for your comment!</description>

		<description>The MDIWindowControlsContainer class is a very welcome addition. One thing I would like to see is the addition to this of a window footer bar (For want of a better word). If you have a look at the windows in Windows XP you see at the bottom of every window a &quot;Footer Bar&quot;. This is outside of the content area of the window and should probably be considered as a control.

What I would like to be able to do is put informative text in that area or maybe even a link to update content in the window.

What do you think?</description>
