		<description>Hi Ben,
IÂ´d like to introduce myself first: I am a webprogrammer from Germany learning Flex/Flash/Air AS, cause IÂ´d like to implement some features to my website: http://www.ticketpoint.de
Well IÂ´ve read most of you post here and they are just great. I like your fresh and your loose writing style. Congrats to you presentation, looking on it I get the feeling that you might have presented it very cool and funny. IÂ´d like to hear you next 360 in Europe:) Thanks for the links, your blog is great because of you!</description>
